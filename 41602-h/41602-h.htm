<h2>PREFATORY</h2>


<p>There is no book in the world which repays earnest study so
abundantly as the Holy Bible. Even the cursory reader who possesses
a candid mind can gather many precious thoughts from its
pages; and he who turns to it for guidance in life, however ignorant
he may be, will never be led astray. But as the precious metal lies
hidden in the mountains, and must be sought out by the miners, so
the treasures in the Word of Life are found only by those who
search diligently for them. He who not only reads but <i>studies</i> the
Scriptures finds an abundant reward. There is need in our age of
searchers in the Bible, who shall bring out of its treasure-house
things new and old.</p>

<p>In the old Bible the most important themes are those which
gather around the God-man, Jesus Christ. His coming to earth
was the culmination of all prophecy, the focus of all history, and
the center of all doctrine; and the church which he founded has been
for nineteen centuries the inspiration of the world's progress.
There are two subjects in the New Testament with which every
follower of Christ should be thoroughly acquainted, and they are its
two most prominent themes: the life of Christ on earth, and the
growth of the early church. In the life of Christ he should know
the order of the leading events; he should grasp its principles, and
should enter into its spirit. Only as we apprehend Christ can we
comprehend the truths taught and inspired by Christ.</p>

<p>But our work as New Testament students must not end with the
story of Christ's ascension from earth. Jesus left behind him a
little church, of only one hundred and twenty members, which in
seventy years overswept all the lands of the greatest empire then
on the earth, and which now covers nearly all the world. Of that
church we are members, inheritors of its traditions, its doctrines,
and&mdash;best of all&mdash;its spirit. It should be our delight to trace the
steps of its early progress, to see how its plans grew with the advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
years, and how an obscure company of Jewish disciples
became a church of world-wide reach.</p>

<p>To enable a student to obtain this knowledge this book has been
prepared. The earlier studies on the life of Christ have been published
as Studies in the Four Gospels, but have been carefully revised
and, in the author's judgment, improved. The studies on the
early church are the outgrowth of work begun many years ago, frequently
revised, taught to classes many times, and carefully restudied
in the light of the most recent researches in the domain of
early church history.</p>

<p>These chapters are, as their titles indicate, <i>studies</i>; designed, not
for reading, but for study. This book does not undertake to be a life
of Christ, and a history of the early church, to be read. It simply
extends a helping hand, and holds out to the student a clue by
means of which he can form his own life of Christ and prepare for
himself a history of the early church. Wherever a fact can be
learned by searching out a Scripture reference the fact is not stated,
but the reference is given. Every text referred to should be searched
out, as these texts contain the essential facts of this book. Whoever
would use these studies rightly must pursue them with the
Bible close at hand, and must consult his Bible more frequently
than this text-book.</p>

<p>There are a million and a half Sunday school teachers who should
be acquainted with the story of Christ and his church: and there are
several millions of young people in our Sunday schools who may be
teachers before many years and need the same knowledge. This
book has been prepared in the hope that these teachers and young
people may find it a help to know Him who is the head of the church;
and to understand the church, which is the pillar and ground of
truth.</p>

<h2>HINTS TO STUDENTS</h2>


<p>Those who desire merely to <i>read</i> this book, or to look it over, will
not find it interesting. Those who already know how to study will
not need these hints, and can use the book in their own way. But
there are many who desire to study these subjects carefully and yet
do not know precisely how to do the work. For these students,
earnest but untrained, these hints are given.</p>

<p>1. These studies should be pursued with the Bible close at hand,
so that every Scripture reference may be at once searched out and
read.</p>

<p>2. Begin each lesson by a general view; reading it through carefully,
and memorizing the leading divisions of the outline, which are
indicated by the Roman numerals I, II, III, etc. This will give the
general plan of the lesson.</p>

<p>3. Now take up Part I of the lesson in detail; notice and memorize
its subdivisions, indicated by 1, 2, 3, etc., and search out all
the Scripture references cited in it. If practicable, write out on a
sheet of paper the reference (not the language of the text in full),
and what each reference shows. Thus with references in the
Second Study, <a href="#Page_19">page <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '17'">19</ins></a>, Section I, <b>Origin</b>, 1. <b>Semitic.</b> (Gen. 12.
1-3) God's call and promise to Abram. (Gen. 17. 1-8) The call
repeated; name changed to Abraham. (James 2. 23) The Friend
of God. (Gen. 18. 19: "He will command his children," etc.)</p>

<p>In this manner write out all the facts ascertained from all the
references in the section.</p>

<p>4. It would be a good plan to write out in full, as a connected
statement, all the facts in the section.</p>

<p>5. In like manner study out and write out all the facts obtained
by a study of the lesson and the text cited in it. This will greatly
aid the memory in holding fast to the information gained.</p>

<p>6. Having done this, look at the blackboard outline at the end
of the study and see if you can read the outline of the lesson by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
aid of the catch-words and indications which it affords. Study the
lesson until you can read it with the blackboard outline, and then
recall it without the outline.</p>

<p>7. Now take up the questions for review. Read them over, one
by one, and see if you can answer them. To many of them the
answer is not given in the text-book, but it will be found in the
Scripture references when searched out. Do not cease your study
until every question can be answered from memory.</p>

<p>8. Frequently review the lessons already learned. Before beginning
the third study review the first and second; before the fourth,
review the first, second and third; and at the completion of the
course review them all. The knowledge gained by this thorough
study will more than compensate for the time and trouble which it
requires.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>




<h2>HINTS TO TEACHERS</h2>


<p>Classes may be organized on various plans and out of varied
materials for the study of these lessons.</p>

<p>1. A teachers' class, composed of teachers and also of senior
scholars in the Sunday school, may be formed to study the life of
Christ, which is one of the most important subjects in the Bible.
This may meet on an evening, or an afternoon, and devote all the
session to the study of the lesson and to discussions upon it.</p>

<p>2. In many places a teachers' meeting is held for the study of the
International Lesson as a preparation for the Sunday school class.
A part of the time might be taken at this meeting for the study of
these subjects. In that case it would be well to follow the division
into lessons, as given on <a href="#Page_11">pages <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '9'">11</ins></a>, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '10'"><a href="#Page_12">12</a></ins>.</p>

<p>3. A normal class may be organized among the brightest scholars
in the Sunday school, who should be trained to become teachers.
This normal class may meet on an afternoon, or an evening, or may
take the lesson period in the Sunday school session.</p>

<p>4. These studies may be pursued by the young people's society
of the church, or by a class formed under its auspices, meeting at
such time and place as shall be found most convenient.</p>

<p>There are two methods in which these lessons may be taught:
One is the <i>lecture method</i>, by which the instructor gives the lesson to
the class in the form of a lecture, placing the outline upon the blackboard
as he proceeds, calling upon the students to read the texts
cited, and frequently reviewing the outline in a concert drill. By
this method the students may or may not have the books, as they
and the instructor prefer. While it is not necessary to supply the
class with the text-book, it will be a good plan to do so. Some lecturers
prefer to have the books closed while the lecture is being given;
but others desire to have the students use the outline in the book
as a syllabus, enabling them to follow the subject more closely.</p>

<p>The other method, simpler and easier, is to let the student have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
copy of the book, to expect the lesson to be prepared by the class,
and to have it recited, either individually or in concert. Let each
student gain all the information that he can upon the subjects of the
lesson; let each bring his knowledge to the possession of all; let all
talk freely, and all will be the gainers.</p>

<p>It would be a good plan to have papers read from time to time
upon the subjects suggested by the course and parallel with it.</p>

<p>Some teachers and classes may regard the contents of this book as
too extensive and may prefer a shorter course. The aim of the
author has been to include in the course only those subjects that
are essential to an understanding of the New Testament, and the
entire series of lessons is recommended; but if a shorter course be
deemed absolutely necessary, two plans are suggested:</p>

<p>1. There are three subjects which under necessity might be
omitted: Second Study, The People of Palestine; Third Study,
General View of the Life of Christ; Twelfth Study, The Synagogue.
This will leave fifteen studies, or twenty-two lessons.</p>

<p>2. Another plan might be undertaken: to take up as a course
the studies on the life of Christ, or even omitting, as above, the
second and third studies, making eight; and to leave the eight
studies in the early church&mdash;a most interesting and valuable
subject&mdash;to a later period.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE COURSE DIVIDED INTO
LESSONS</h2>


<p>For the convenience of teachers and classes, the eighteen studies
of this course are divided into twenty-five lessons, as follows:</p>

<h2>FIRST STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Land of Palestine</div>


<p>In the historical study of the New Testament the two principal
subjects are, the life of Jesus Christ on earth and, after the Ascension,
the growth of the Christian church.</p>

<p>The life of Christ was passed entirely in Palestine; and we therefore
begin our studies with a view of that land as it was in our
Saviour's day.</p>

<p>I. <b>It was an oriental land.</b> In all ages the boundaries of Palestine
have been about the same, though the dominion of its rulers has
varied according to their power. Palestine Proper, originally the
land of Canaan, and later the land of Israel, or the Twelve Tribes, is
located near the south-eastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea;
having Syria and Ph&oelig;nicia on the north, the great Syrian Desert on
the east, the Sinaitic wilderness on the south, and the Mediterranean
on the west. Located just outside the tropics, near the point of contact
between Asia and Africa, it belongs to the Oriental or Eastern
world.</p>

<p>II. <b>It was a small land.</b> The greatest lands have not always been
the largest. Greece, no larger than half a dozen counties in America,
is greater in history than vast China; and the single city of Rome
won and held the empire of the Mediterranean lands. Territorially
the whole extent of Palestine was about that of Massachusetts and
Connecticut united, or that of Switzerland, in Europe&mdash;about 12,500
square miles. Its sea-coast, from Tyre to Gaza, is 140 miles long;
its Jordan line, from Mount Hermon to the foot of the Dead Sea, is
156 miles.</p>

<p>III. <b>It was a land of varied natural features.</b> There is a regularity
in the natural conformation of Palestine which every traveler
notices. The country lies in five parallel sections.</p>

<p>1. Approaching from the Mediterranean one meets first a <b>sea-coast
plain</b> two or three miles wide at the north, but widening, as it
goes southward, to nearly twenty miles at Gaza.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Crossing this we approach the <b>Shephelah</b>, <i>or foot-hills</i>; a terrace
of low hills, from 300 to 500 feet high.</p>

<p>3. Ascending these we reach <b>the mountain region</b>, a range of
mountains broken by ravines in all directions, and varying from
2,500 to 3,000 feet high. This region was the home of the Israelites
in all their history. They were always a mountain people and never
occupied the lower plains in any great degree. In all the Bible
times the plains and valleys were mainly foreign and heathen in
their population, while the mountains were Israelite in the Old Testament
and Jewish in the New.</p>

<p>4. Crossing the mountains we descend to the <b>Jordan valley</b>,
lower than the sea level and from five to twenty miles wide. Through
this runs the river Jordan, passing through two lakes&mdash;Lake Merom
and the Sea of Galilee&mdash;and emptying into the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>5. Beyond the valley rises the <b>eastern table-land</b>, with higher
mountains, but more level summits, and broken by fewer valleys.
The mountains gradually decline to the great Syrian Desert on the
east.</p>

<p>IV. <b>It was a Land of Five Provinces.</b> In the time of Christ
there were five political divisions in Palestine; three on the west
side of Jordan and two on the east.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 173px;">
<a href="images/i016-big.jpg"><img src="images/i016.jpg" width="173" height="250" alt="Map: PALESTINE In the time of CHRIST" /></a>
</div>

<p>1. On the north, west of the Jordan,
was the province of <b>Galilee</b>, situated between
the river Jordan, the Sea of Galilee,
the land of Ph&oelig;nicia and Mount
Carmel. It was inhabited by a brave,
simple-hearted people, mainly Jews, but
with many Gentiles among them. Hence
its name (Isa. 9. 1, 2; Matt. 4. 15, 16); and
the contempt in which it was held at
Jerusalem. (John 7. 41, 52.) It was
the home of Jesus during most of his life
and ministry.</p>

<p>2. The central region was <b>Samaria</b>.
See its location. (John 4. 3, 4.) It was,
strictly speaking, not a province but a district around the cities
of Shechem and Samaria, not extending either to the sea or
river, and of uncertain limits, inhabited by a composite people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
partly Israelite, partly heathen, in their origin. Note the claim
of its people (John 4. 12) and their expectation. (John 4. 25.)
Observe how they were regarded by the Jews. (John 4. 9; 8. 48.)
Notice that Christ paid no regard to this caste prejudice.
(John 4. 10.)</p>

<p>3. The southernmost province of Palestine was <b>Judea</b>. As the
largest, and the special home of the Jewish people, it often gave its
name to the whole land, as in Mark 1. 5; Luke 7. 17; Acts 10. 37.
Generally, however, it is distinguished as the name of the province,
as in Luke 2. 4; Matt. 2. 22; John 4. 3. Jesus made several visits
to this district, especially to its city, but only for limited periods, as
its people were more bigoted than the Galileans and bitterly opposed
to him.</p>

<p>4. On the east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea was the province
of <b>Peræa</b>, a word meaning "beyond." It is not mentioned by that
name in the New Testament. Notice what it is called in Matt. 19. 1;
Mark 10. 1. We read of a visit paid by Jesus to this region near
the close of his ministry.</p>

<p>5. North of the river Hieromax, and east of the Sea of Galilee,
was a fifth province, the ancient land of <b>Bashan</b>, "woodland,"
but known in the gospels as "Philip's tetrarchy." Notice how it is
specified in Luke 3. 1. Another name for a part of this territory
is given in Matt. 4. 25; Mark 5. 20; 7. 31. Its inhabitants were
mostly Gentiles or heathen. Twice this country enjoyed brief visits
from Jesus, each marked by a miracle (Mark 5. 1-20; 7. 31-37).</p>

<p>V. <b>It was a Populous Land.</b> We can only note the places referred
to in the gospel history, and we arrange them according to the provinces.</p>

<p>1. In Galilee we note: 1.) <b>Nazareth</b>, due west of the southern
end of the Sea of Galilee, the early home of Jesus (Matt. 2. 23;
Luke 2. 51). 2.) <b>Nain</b>, south of Nazareth, where he wrought a
miracle (Luke 7. 11). 3.) <b>Cana</b>, north of Nazareth, where the first
miracle was wrought (John 2. 1). 4.) <b>Capernaum</b>, on the Sea of
Galilee, the home of Jesus during most of his ministry, and the
scene of many miracles (Luke 4. 31; Mark 2. 1).</p>

<p>2. In Samaria we note two places: 1.) <b>Shechem</b>, which may
be the place referred to in John 4. 5, though late authorities regard
it as the name of a hamlet, now called Iskar, near by. 2.) <b>Samaria</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a few miles north-west of Shechem, the early capital of the province,
and the first place where the Gospel was preached to other than the
Jews (Acts 8. 5).</p>

<p>3. In the province of Judea we notice: 1.) <b>Jerusalem</b>, "the
holy city" (Matt. 4. 5), and the place where Jesus was crucified
(Matt. 16. 21). 2.) <b>Bethany</b>, two miles east of Jerusalem (John 11.
18), where Jesus was entertained by Mary and Martha (John 11. 1).
Note two great events near this place (John 11. 43; Luke 24. 50,
51). 3.) <b>Bethlehem</b>, six miles south of Jerusalem. The great event
in its history (Matt. 2. 1.) Its ancient honor (Luke 2. 4.) 4.) <b>Hebron</b>,
the ancient capital of Judah, a priestly city, and the probable birthplace
of John the Baptist (Luke 1. 39, 40.) 5.) <b>Jericho</b>, eighteen
miles from Jerusalem, in the Jordan valley, visited by Jesus near
the end of his ministry (Luke 19. 1). 6.) <b>Ephraim</b>, a village
fourteen miles north of Jerusalem, the hiding place of Jesus for a
brief period (John 11. 54).</p>

<p>4. In the province of Peræa but one place is identified as connected
with the life of Christ: <b>Bethabara</b> (Revised version, "Bethany
beyond the Jordan") the place of the baptism and of the first
disciples; thirteen miles south of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p>5. In Philip's tetrarchy, east of the Sea of Galilee, we note three
places: 1.) <b>Cæsarea Philippi</b>, at the foot of the Mount Hermon
(Mark 8. 27; 9. 2). 2.) <b>Bethsaida</b>, at the head of the Sea of
Galilee, east of the Jordan (Luke 9. 10-13). 3.) <b>Gergesa</b> or
<b>Gerasa</b>, a little place on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee (Matt.
8. 28).</p>

<p>VI. <b>It was a Subject Land.</b> Half a century before the birth
of Christ the Jews became subject to Rome, and thenceforward
various changes took place in the form of government:</p>

<p>1. The whole land, with some surrounding provinces, was a
<b>kingdom</b> under Herod the Great (Matt. 2. 1), but tributary to the
emperor at Rome from 37 B. C. to 4 B. C., the year of Christ's
birth.</p>

<p>2. On Herod's death it was divided into three <b>tetrarchies</b>,
"fourth-part rules." Archelaus became tetrarch of Judea and
Samaria (Matt. 2. 22); Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee and Peræa
(Matt. 14. 1; Luke 23. 6, 7); Herod Philip, tetrarch of the Bashan
district (Luke 3. 1). A fourth tetrarchy, outside of Palestine, on
the north, was held by Lysanias (Luke 3. 1).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>3. About the year 7 A. D., when Jesus was eleven years old,
Archelaus was deposed by the Roman emperor and his dominion
made a province under a Roman procurator, the other two tetrarchies
remaining undisturbed. This was the form of government
during the ministry of Jesus. Judea and Samaria constituting one
Roman province under Pontius
Pilate; Galilee and
Peræa, Herod's tetrarchy,
and Bashan, Philip's tetrarchy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">
<a href="images/i019-big.jpg"><img src="images/i019.jpg" width="180" height="300" alt="map: NEW TESTAMENT PALESTINE" /></a>
</div>

<p>4. In the year 37 the
Roman emperor made
Herod Agrippa I. king first
over Judea, and then, in 41,
over all the dominions of
his grandfather, so that
Palestine became a kingdom
again. He is mentioned
in Acts 12. 1.</p>

<p>5. On Agrippa's death,
in A. D. 44, a new division
took place. Agrippa II., son
of Agrippa I., became ruler
of Chalcis and Bashan. He
is called, but by courtesy
only, "King Agrippa," in
Acts 25. 13; 26. 1, 2. The
rest of Palestine, consisting
of Judea, Samaria, and
Peræa, became again a procuratorship
under direct
Roman rule. See Acts 23.
24; 24. 27.</p>

<p>6. On the rebellion of the Jews, A. D. 66, the government was
again changed. Palestine became a part of Syria, under Vespasian,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he'">the</ins> legate. This was the end of Jewish history as a separate
nationality.</p>

<h2>SECOND STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The People of Palestine</div>


<p>In all the ancient world there was but one people among whom
Christ could have come with his revelation, and through whom his
message could have been given to mankind. That people was <b>the
Jews</b>, in certain respects the most remarkable of all the races.</p>

<p>I. We notice their <b>origin</b>, which shows a series of selections extending
through many centuries and a training for their peculiar
mission.</p>

<p>1. Of the three great families of earth, they sprang from the
<b>Semitic</b>, which has been the mother of all the great religions of the
world; a thoughtful, meditative race, rather than active and aggressive.</p>

<p>2. From this race <b>Abraham</b> was called, more than twenty centuries
before Christ, to be the father of a great nation (Gen. 12. 1-3;
17. 1-8). He was distinguished for his worship of the one God, for
his faith, and for his nobility of character. Notice his title in Jas.
2. 23; a name by which he is still known in the East, <i>el Khalil</i>,
"the Friend." His influence upon his family (Gen. 18. 19).</p>

<p>3. Of the families descended from Abraham that of <b>Isaac</b> was
chosen (Gen. 21. 12; Rom. 9. 7). All the other races of Abrahamic
origin yielded to the idolatrous influences around them and lost the
knowledge of God.</p>

<p>4. Of the two sons of Isaac one married among the Canaanites,
and, as a result, his descendants became idolaters (Gen. 26. 34, 35;
36. 2). The other chose the inheritance of the covenant (Gen.
28. 20-22). His name was changed (Gen. 32. 28; 35. 10). His
descendants, the <b>Israelites</b>, trained up in the true faith, became the
people of God. Each of his twelve sons was the ancestor of a tribe
(Exod. 1. 1-7). They continued one people for a thousand years,
though part of the time divided into two kingdoms.</p>

<p>5. In the year 721 B. C. ten of the twelve tribes were carried into
Assyrian captivity (2 Kings 17. 18-20). Having lost their religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the only bond of unity, they mingled with the idolatrous world and
ceased to be a separate people. The <b>tribe of Judah</b> was left, Benjamin
being incorporated with it. Henceforth they were called
"the Jews," a name found first in 2 Kings 18. 26.</p>

<p>6. But through all the history of Judah, as well as of Israel, there
had been two distinct elements in the people: the worshipers of God
and of idols; the religious and the worldly. In order to separate
these elements, to cut off the evil and to discipline the good, came
the Babylonian captivity, B. C. 587. Through this the idolatrous
element was either destroyed or assimilated with the heathen world.
At the release from captivity, B. C. 536, all the Jews were of God-fearing,
Scripture-loving element. This was <b>the Remnant</b>, the
"holy seed," the true Israel (Isa. 6. 8-13).</p>

<p>Thus, out of all the world, was gradually chosen and prepared a
people among whom the Lord should come.</p>

<p>II. Notice <b>their traits</b> as a race, for which they were chosen, and
which were intensified by their training:</p>

<p>1. They were a <b>religious</b> people; monotheistic; worshiping the
one invisible God, hating idolatry. See the command (Exod. 20.
3-6). The exhortation of Joshua (Josh. 24. 14). This is the great
glory of Israel alone among the ancient nations.</p>

<p>2. They were an <b>exclusive</b> people; strongly attached to each
other, and seeking no affiliation with other races. Note this trait in
Abraham (Gen. 24. 2-4). Also in Isaac (Gen. 28. 1, 2). See
Balaam's prophecy (Num. 23. 9). To this day the Jews dwell
apart; in most European cities there is a "Jewish quarter."</p>

<p>3. They were a <b>conservative</b> people; attached to their own customs,
opposed to all changes, clinging to their worship despite
persecution.</p>

<p>4. They were an <b>aspiring</b> people. From their earliest history
the Jews cherished the expectation of being a great and conquering
nation. From their own prophecies they obtained the hope and
belief that a great king should arise among them to rule the world.
See the promises in Gen. 49. 10. The prophecy in Isa. 32. 1, 2.
His title in Dan. 9. 25. The word "Messiah" in Hebrew is
"Christos" in Greek, and "Anointed" in English. This messianic
hope was the central thought of all Judaism.</p>

<p>5. They were a <b>moral</b> people. Their Scripture set up a standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of character immeasurably superior to that in other ancient
lands. Among the Jews womanhood was honored, drunkenness
was rare, honesty was the rule, and crime was far less frequent than
elsewhere.</p>

<p>These were the traits that made the Jews the people of God and
fitted them to accomplish the divine purpose.</p>

<p>III. What was that purpose? Every race has its mission in the
world. The Greeks were set to exalt the intellect; the Romans,
to establish the reign of law. We notice the <b>mission of the Jewish
people</b>:</p>

<p>1. <b>To perpetuate the knowledge of God.</b> In the general wickedness
of the world and the spread of idolatry there was danger
lest the true religion be utterly lost. Therefore God chose out one
nation&mdash;the one having the traits best fitting it for his purpose&mdash;and
set it apart to guard the holy fire of divine truth until the rest of the
world should be ready to receive it.</p>

<p>2. <b>To receive training for higher revelation.</b> The higher revelations
of God can come only to a people whose religious faculties
have been trained to receive them. Judaism was God's school
where a chosen race was educated. They received the Scriptures,
the prophets, the ritual of worship, and, above all, the discipline
of trial, fitting them to become "a nation of priests." See Paul's
enumeration of their privileges in Rom. 9. 4, 5.</p>

<p>3. <b>To proclaim the Gospel to the world.</b> When, in the fullness
of time, Israel was trained up to knowledge and the outer world
prepared to receive the truth, Christ came as the consummation of
Judaism. Then a new mission opened before the Jews&mdash;that of proclaiming
Christ to the world. The little company of disciples were
the seed that should replenish the whole earth. See the command.
(Matt. 28. 19, 20.)</p>

<p>IV. We notice now the <b>Jews in the time of Christ</b>.</p>

<p>1. They were divided into two great <b>branches</b>: the <b>Jews of Palestine</b>
and the <b>Jews of the Dispersion</b>. The former were descendants
of those who had settled in Palestine after the decree of Cyrus,
B. C. 536 (Ezra 1. 1-3); the latter those who remained in the lands
of their adoption, were found all over the ancient world, and were
far more numerous. See references to them in John 7. 35; James 1.
1; 1 Pet. 1. 1. We note that these "Jews of the Dispersion" were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
not descendants of the Ten Tribes, except in a few instances, but
were <i>Jews</i>&mdash;that is, descendants of Judah.</p>

<p>2. Noticing now the Palestinian Jews, for with these the life of
Christ was mainly connected, we find them divided into two <b>sects</b>, or
schools of thought: the <b>Pharisees</b> and the <b>Sadducees</b>. These two
parties arose about 168 B. C., in the time of the Maccabæan uprising.
Let us look at them in contrast.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) Their <i>names</i> express their traits. <i>Pharisee</i> means "separatist,"
"one who is apart." <i>Sadducee</i> means "just," or
"righteous," but rather with our idea of the world "moralist."</p>

<p>2.) Their <i>aims</i>. The Pharisee aimed to keep the Mosaic law
absolutely, particularly with regard to ceremonial requirements;
to do more than obey it, by setting around it a hedge
of traditional interpretations going beyond its letter in strictness.
The Sadducee professed to keep the law, ignoring
tradition, but gave it a lax and easy interpretation which
often ignored its requirements.</p>

<p>3.) Their <i>spirit</i>. The Pharisee was the radical and zealot,
showing an intense, intolerant Judaism. The Sadducee was
the liberal easy-going man of the world, taking the world as
he found it.</p>

<p>4.) Their <i>beliefs</i>. The Pharisee believed in a spiritual world,
heaven, hell, angels, the hereafter, the judgment. The Sadducee
could not find clear statements of these doctrines in
the Old Testament, and denied them. See Matt. 22. 23;
Acts 23. 8.</p>

<p>5.) Their <i>influence</i>. The Pharisees were strong in the synagogues,
where the scribes gave their interpretations, and
hence were powerful among the people as leaders in religion.
The Sadducees were the smaller body, but influential from
their wealth and their social position, for the high priests and
all the priestly order belonged to them, and they were the
office-holding class, the court party. (Acts 4. 1, 2; 5. 17.)</p>

<p>6.) Their <i>evils</i>. The evil of the Pharisees was their tendency
to make religion mere hypocritical formality, so often rebuked
by Christ. See Matt. 23. 2-7. The evil of the Sadducees
was their utter lack of moral conviction, from worldliness
and self-interest. See their motive for putting Christ
to death (John 11. 47-50).</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Thus far we have noticed only Jews, but there were also in
Palestine many <b>Gentiles</b>, which was the name the Jews gave to all
foreigners or people of race other than themselves. These were of
three classes, called respectively: 1.) <b>Sinners</b>&mdash;That is, those who
made no attempt to observe Jewish usages. See Gal. 2. 15. The
same name was given to the Jews who did not undertake to keep the
ceremonial law, without reference to their moral character (Matt.
9. 10, 11). 2.) <b>The Devout.</b> Those who believed in the Scriptures
and worshiped God, but who had not been received into the Jewish
Church by circumcision. Such was Cornelius (Acts 10. 1, 2). 3.)
<b>Proselytes</b>&mdash;Such as renounced Gentilism, received circumcision,
and obeyed the Jewish law (Acts 6. 5; Matt. 23. 15).</p>

<p>V. <b>The Language of Palestine.</b></p>

<p>1. Originally <b>Hebrew</b>; still read, in Christ's time, in the synagogue
but not well understood and requiring an interpreter.</p>

<p>2. Mostly <b>Aramaic</b>, or <b>Syro-Chaldaic</b>&mdash;that is, Chaldaic with
Syrian admixture; the common dialect of the people, and undoubtedly
spoken by Christ. See instances in Mark 7. 34; 15. 34. This is
the language referred to in John 19. 20, 21, and Acts 22. 2, as
"Hebrew."</p>

<p>3. The language of polite literature in all countries was <b>Greek</b>;
strongly opposed by the Pharisees, but employed by the Jews of the
Dispersion, and used in the courts of Herod and Pilate (Acts 21. 37).</p>

<p>4. The official language was <b>Latin</b>, that of the Roman Government,
but not used by the Jews, and not generally understood by
them.</p>

<h2>THIRD STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Life of Christ</div>


<p>The central figure in all the Bible is Jesus Christ. Note his importance
in the Old Testament (John 5. 39; Luke 24. 27; Acts 10. 43).
Note his prominence in all true gospel teaching (1 Cor. 2. 2).
Note his relation to every man (John 1. 9.) (Rev. Ver.) We have,
then, an interest in Jesus Christ deeper than in any other man who
ever lived.</p>

<p>I. Let us notice some <b>General Aspects of his Life</b>.</p>

<p>1. It was a <b>short</b> life. This man, who has influenced the world
more than any other, lived less than <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thrty-five'">thirty-five</ins> years. His age at
the beginning of his ministry we learn from Luke 3. 23; and the duration
of his ministry was not more than three years and a half at the
longest.</p>

<p>2. It was a life <b>passed wholly in Palestine</b>. Only once do we
read of his journeying near any other country, and it is not probable
that he went beyond its borders (Mark 7. 24). The only times of
direct contact with Gentiles are mentioned (Mark 7. 25, 26; John 12. 20-22).
He never enjoyed the benefits of foreign travel, of communion
with learned men in the great cities, of studies at the universities
of Athens or Alexandria. All his knowledge came from
within.</p>

<p>3. It was a life <b>among the common people</b>. He lived in a despised
province (John 7. 41, 52). He came from a despised town
(John 1. 46). He was a working mechanic (Mark 6. 3). He
received only a common education (John 7. 15). His manner of life
during his ministry (Matt. 8. 20). Yet out of these lowly surroundings
grew up the one exalted character, the one perfect life, in all
human history.</p>

<p>4. It was an <b>active</b> life. The first thirty years may have been
spent in quiet preparation, but the three years of his ministry were
very busy. See pictures in Mark 1. 36-38; 2. 1-4; 6. 31-34. Notice
the hyperbole in John 21. 25, which is not to be taken literally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
But if the whole life of Jesus were related with the minuteness of
the day between the sunset of the Last Supper and that of the burial
the narration would require one hundred and eighty-five books as
large as the Bible.</p>

<p>II. Let us arrange the events of Christ's life in chronological
order, grouping them into <b>Seven Periods</b>.</p>

<p>1. The first period is that of <b>The Thirty Years of Preparation</b>,
of which we notice the following facts:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) It begins with his Birth (Luke 2. 7), and ends with his
Temptation (Matt. 4. 1).</p>

<p>2.) It is related mainly by Luke (Luke 1-4) with some facts
in Matthew (Matt. 1. 2; 4. 1-11), and a brief mention of its
closing events in Mark (Mark 1. 9-13).</p>

<p>3.) It was passed mainly in Galilee, though with isolated
events in Judea, in Egypt (Matt. 2. 14, 15), and in Peræa.
See John 1. 28.</p>

<p>4.) It was the longest of all the periods, embracing nine-tenths
of his life; yet it is the one having the fewest incidents recorded;
and of eighteen years in it absolutely no events are
known.</p></div>

<p>2. Next is <b>The Year of Obscurity</b>. In this and the two succeeding
periods the year is not a precise epoch, and may have been a little less
or a little more.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) It begins with the first followers (John 1. 35-37), and
ends with the return to Galilee (John 4. 43, 44).</p>

<p>2.) It is related only by John, who, of all the gospel writers,
records the visit of Jesus to Judea and Jerusalem.</p>

<p>3.) It was passed principally in Judea, though with visits to
Galilee, and on the way a visit to Samaria.</p>

<p>4.) It is justly called a "year of obscurity," for we know but
little concerning either its aims, its events, or its results. It
was accompanied with miracles (John 3. 2; 4. 45). It
attracted attention (John 3. 26; 4. 1). Yet at its close we
find that the followers of Jesus were few, and he went to
Galilee to begin his ministry anew.</p></div>

<p>3. <b>The Year of Popularity</b>, in marked contrast with the preceding
period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p><div class='blockquot'><p>1.) It begins with the Rejection at Nazareth (Luke 4. 14-30),
and ends with the Discourse on the Bread of Life (John 6.
25-71), a day or two after the miracle of Feeding the Five
Thousand.</p>

<p>2.) It is related by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, with some
additional incidents by John.</p>

<p>3.) The scene of the Saviour's ministry was in Galilee, which
he traversed extensively during this year. One visit to Jerusalem
is related by John (John 5. 1, 2).</p>

<p>4.) It was a year of great activity, spent in incessant journeys,
preaching, and works of mercy, and the most popular period
of the Saviour's life, when the crowds were greatest and the
people seemed ready to accept Jesus as the Messiah of Israel.
Yet at its close, as before, he was left alone with his twelve
disciples (John 6. 66-68).</p></div>

<p>4. Another period we find in <b>The Year of Opposition</b>, again
contrasted with the year before it.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) It begins with the Retirement to Ph&oelig;nicia (Mark 7. 24)
and ends with the Anointing by Mary (John 12. 1-3).</p>

<p>2.) It is recorded in all the gospels in almost equal measure,
Luke giving the most complete account of the ministry in
Peræa, and John, as usual, relating the visit to Judea.</p>

<p>3.) This period is peculiar in the fact that in it Jesus visited
all the five provinces of Palestine. We find him in Decapolis
(which was a part of the Bashan district) (Mark 7. 31);
passing through Galilee (Mark 9. 30); also through Samaria
(Luke 9. 51, 52); in Peræa (Mark 10. 1), and in Judea
(John 11. 7).</p>

<p>4.) This part of the Saviour's life has been variously characterized
as "a ministry of sorrow and humiliation," "a year
of instruction," and "a period of retirement." All are correct,
for during this, the last year of his life, Jesus sought to
be alone with his disciples, and in order to escape the crowds
visited places where he was unknown. He aimed to instruct
his disciples in the deeper truths of the gospel, to prepare
their minds for his approaching death and for their mission
as apostles (Matt. 16. 21).</p></div>

<p>5. We now approach the close of Christ's life on earth, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
narration is more detailed as the cross comes nearer to view. Our
next period is <b>The Week of the Passion</b>.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) Beginning with the Triumphal Entry on the Sunday
before the Passover (John 21. 12, 13), it ends with the Agony
in the Garden about midnight on Thursday (Matt. 26. 36);
thus embracing strictly but five days.</p>

<p>2.) It is related in all the gospels, John alone adding the
teaching given at the Last Supper (John 13-17).</p>

<p>3.) All the events of this period took place in or near Jerusalem.</p>

<p>4.) This was the last call of Christ to the Jews of Jerusalem,
and his final rebuke for their rejection of his ministry.</p></div>

<p>6. <b>The Day of the Crucifixion.</b> The most important day in all
earth's history was that when Jesus died upon the cross. It is also
the day whose events are narrated more fully than any other in the
Bible annals. Therefore we study it apart from the rest of the week
as a separate period.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) It begins with the Arrest (Matt. 26. 47), soon after midnight,
Friday <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, the day of the Passover, and ends at
about sunset of the same day with the Burial (Matt. 27.
59, 60).</p>

<p>2.) Each gospel adds its portion to the account, that of John,
an eye-witness of all the events, being the most complete.</p>

<p>3.) The events took place in Jerusalem; but few, if any, of the
localities are known with certainty.</p>

<p>4.) In the scenes of this day we see Jesus as the suffering
Saviour, bearing the sins of the world.</p></div>

<p>7. Last of all come <b>The Forty Days of Resurrection</b>.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) From the Resurrection, early on the first Easter Sunday
(Matt. 28. 1-8), to the Ascension, forty days afterward (Acts
1. 1-3).</p>

<p>2.) All the gospels give accounts of the appearances of the
risen Saviour, but Luke alone tells the story of his Ascension
(Luke 24. 50, 51; Acts 1. 9-11).</p>

<p>3.) The manifestations of Christ after his Resurrection took
place in and near Jerusalem, near the village of Emmaus
(Luke 24. 13), and in Galilee (Matt. 28. 16; John 21. 1).</p>

<p>4.) During this period the visible revelation of Christ was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
constant, but occasional; to his disciples only, never to his
enemies; and of a spiritual body, which was freed from the
restraints of the flesh (Mark 16. 12; Luke 24. 31; John 20.
19).</p></div>

<h2>FOURTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Thirty Years of Preparation</div>

<h3>From the Birth of Jesus to His Temptation.</h3>


<p>We have before us the longest of all the divisions in the history of
Jesus, embracing thirty of his thirty-three years of life, and the one
concerning which we know the least.</p>

<p>I. Let us study the <b>Places</b> connected with this period. These
we group according to locality, and not in the order of their events.
Beginning in the north and traveling southward we note the following
places:</p>

<p>1. <b>Nazareth, his early home</b>, in Galilee, due west of the southern
point of the Sea of Galilee. Here Joseph and Mary lived before the
birth of Jesus (Luke 2. 39); here Jesus was brought up (Luke 4. 16);
and here he was living up to the time of his baptism (Mark 1. 9).</p>

<p>2. <b>Bethabara</b> (Rev. Ver., Bethany), <b>the place of his baptism</b>.
This was in the Jordan valley, south of the Sea of Galilee. (John
1. 28).</p>

<p>3. <b>The wilderness, the place of his temptation.</b> (Matt. 4. 1.)
This was probably the rocky desolate region of Judea, near the
head of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>4. <b>Jerusalem, the place of the Temple</b>; the Jewish capital, due
west of the northern point of the Dead Sea. Find three visits of
Jesus to the temple during this period. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this number">1.)</ins> In his infancy (Luke
2. 22). 2.) In his youth (Luke 2. 42). 3.) In his manhood (Luke
4. 9).</p>

<p>5. <b>Bethlehem, the place of his birth.</b> (Matt. 2. 1). This was
six miles south of Jerusalem, in Judea.</p>

<p>6. <b>Egypt, the place of his refuge.</b> (Matt. 2. 14). This was the
land south-west of Palestine, where Jesus was taken in his infancy
in order to escape from King Herod.</p>

<p>Let the student 1.) Draw a map showing these places. 2.) Memorize
the list. 3.) With each place name its event in the life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Jesus. 4.) Find other events of Scripture history connected with
these places.</p>

<p>II. Let us arrange in order the <b>Events</b> of this period. 1. <b>The
annunciation of his birth.</b> 1.) To Mary (Luke 1. 26-38). 2.) To
Joseph (Matt. 1. 20, 21). 3.) To Simeon (Luke 2. 25, 26). 4.)
To the shepherds (Luke 2. 8-11).</p>

<p>2. <b>The birth at Bethlehem.</b> Note the purpose for which Joseph
and Mary went to Bethlehem (Luke 2. 1-4). The circumstances of
his birth (Luke 2. 6, 7).</p>

<p>3. <b>The welcome to the child.</b> 1.) On the night of his birth
(Luke 2. 15). 2.) A few days later (Matt. 2. 1, 11). 3.) In the
temple (Luke 2. 25-28, 36, 38).</p>

<p>4. <b>The refuge in Egypt</b> (Matt. 2. 13-15). This may have been
for a few weeks, a few months, or for a few years.</p>

<p>5. <b>The childhood at Nazareth</b> (Matt. 2. 22, 23; Luke 2. 39, 40).
By what route would the journey from Egypt be made?</p>

<p>6. <b>The visit to the temple.</b> Read the account in Luke 2. 41-52,
and notice: 1.) The age of Jesus. 2.) The object of the journey.
3.) Probable route. 4.) Where he tarried and why. 5.) The
objects of his interest. 6.) Traits of his character shown.</p>

<p>7. <b>The silent years.</b> From the age of twelve to that of thirty
no events are named. His home was still at Nazareth (John 1. 45).</p>

<p>8. <b>The woodworker at Nazareth.</b> From the fact that Joseph
is not referred to after the visit to the temple it may be presumed
that he died before the ministry of Jesus began. He had been a
"carpenter" (Matt. 13. 35); although the word means, more precisely,
"a skilled worker in wood," and may refer to the making of
almost anything except houses, which were not built of wood. Jesus
followed the same trade (Mark 6. 3) and, as the oldest son, supported
his widowed mother and younger brothers and sisters (Mark
6. 3).</p>

<p>9. <b>The baptism in Jordan.</b> Compare the four accounts (Matt.
3. 13-17; Mark 1. 9-11; Luke 3. 21, 22; John 1. 28-34); and find:
1.) The place. 2.) The age of Jesus. 3.) The baptizer. 4.) The
divine manifestation.</p>

<p>10. <b>The temptation in the wilderness.</b> This followed immediately
upon the baptism, and was a preparation for his ministry (Matt.
4. 1-11; Mark 1. 12, 13; Luke 4. 1-13). Note: 1.) The place. 2.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The personality of the tempter. 3.) The three forms of temptation.
4.) How repelled. 5.) The result.</p>

<p>Let the student, 1.) Memorize these nine events in their order.
2.) Read the account of each in the gospels. 3.) Recall where each
took place. 4.) Notice what other persons besides Jesus are named
in the period (for example, Joseph, Mary, Simeon, Anna, Herod,
etc.) and each one's part in the events.</p>

</div>

<p>III. Draw the map
of Palestine, locating
upon it the live places
named; and then indicate
the following
<b>Journeys</b> of the period:
1. From Bethlehem to
Jerusalem (for the presentation
in the temple)
and return. 2.
From Bethlehem to
Egypt (flight from
Herod). 3. From Egypt
to Nazareth. 4. From
Nazareth to Jerusalem
and return (visit to
temple). 5. From Nazareth
to Bethabara
(baptism). 6. Bethabara
to the wilderness
(temptation).</p>

<p>IV. Let us now
study the <b>External
Conditions</b> of Christ's
life during this period.</p>

<p>1. <b>The family.</b> The
royal line of both Joseph
and Mary (Matt.
1. 1; Luke 1. 27, 32). Their obscure social condition (Matt.
13. 54, 55). In all probability they belonged to the better class of
self-supporting workers: for Joseph followed a trade.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <b>The house.</b> Probably like those of working people in Palestine;
built of clay, one story high, containing but one room with no
window, but lighted through the door; whitewashed on the outside;
floor of earth.</p>

<p>3. <b>The furniture.</b> A couch that could be rolled up (Mark 2. 12).
A lamp, a lamp-stand, "the bushel" (used as seat, table, and dish
(Matt. 5. 15). Hand-mill for grinding (Deut. 24. 6; Matt. 24. 41).
Probably neither chair, table, nor bedstead.</p>

<p>4. <b>Education.</b> Jesus received only the common schooling, not
a college education (John 7. 15). Contrast with the early advantages
of Paul (Acts 22. 3). Every synagogue had a school taught by
"the minister." See Luke 4. 20. He was not a priest, nor even a
scribe, but properly the curator or sexton of the synagogue, and all
the teaching was the reading of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>5. <b>Religious training.</b></p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) There was the influence of a godly man and woman.
Joseph, "a just man," living in fellowship with God. (Matt.
1. 19, 20). The character of Mary (Luke 1. 38; 2. 19, 51).</p>

<p>2.) The instruction in the Scriptures at home (Deut. 6. 7.)</p>

<p>3.) The daily prayers, morning and evening, always observed
(Matt. 6. 5, 6).</p>

<p>4.) The Sabbath rest (Mark 2. 27).</p>

<p>5.) The worship of the synagogue (Luke 4. 16; Mark 6. 2.)</p>

<p>6.) The great feasts, celebrated each year at Jerusalem&mdash;Passover,
Pentecost, and Tabernacles&mdash;which Joseph and Mary
attended (Luke 2. 41).</p></div>

<p>Under these influences Jesus grew up to manhood.</p>

<h2>FIFTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Year of Obscurity</div>

<h3>From the First Followers of Jesus to His Return to Galilee.</h3>


<p>I. <b>Preliminary Notes</b> on the period.</p>

<p>1. <b>Sources of Information.</b> Our only account of this period is
contained in <b>John's Gospel</b>. Read carefully John 1. 19 to 4. 54 for
all the facts on record.</p>

<p>2. <b>Time.</b> The Saviour came from the temptation in the wilderness
either late in February or early in March, A. D. 27, and
he began his ministry in Galilee in May, A. D. 28; so that this period
embraced nearly <b>fifteen months</b>. (Edersheim. According to
Andrews it ended in March, and was a year in duration).</p>

<p>3. <b>Locality.</b> Most of this year was passed in <b>Judea</b>, though there
is mention of one journey to <b>Galilee</b> soon after the beginning (John
1. 43), and of another at the close (John 4. 3).</p>

<p>4. <b>Aim.</b> It is probable that Jesus began his ministry in Judea,
the leading province, in order to give to the leaders of the nation the
<b>first opportunity</b> of accepting him as the Messiah of Israel. Not
until Jerusalem and Judea had rejected him did he turn to the
people of Galilee.</p>

<p>II. <b>Places.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>Bethabara</b> (or Bethany, as in Rev. Ver.) (John 1. 28).
Here occurred the meeting of Jesus with his first followers (John 1. 37).</p>

<p>2. <b>Cana</b>, the place of the first miracle (John 2. 1). This was in
Galilee, not far from Nazareth.</p>

<p>3. <b>Capernaum</b>, named only as a place of a brief visit by Jesus at
this time, but later more prominent in the history (John 2. 12).
Situated on the north-western shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p>4. <b>Sychar</b>, the place of the Samaritan ministry (John 4. 5, 40).
This was formerly supposed to be the well-known city of Shechem,
but is now more accurately fixed at <i>Askar</i>, a small village near to
Jacob's well.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <b>Jerusalem.</b> During this period two events took place in Jerusalem&mdash;the
cleansing of the temple (John 2. 14, 15), and the conversation
with Nicodemus (John 3. 1-21).</p>

</div>

<p>III. <b>Journeys.</b> We begin
in the wilderness of the
temptation. 1. From the
wilderness to Bethabara.
2. From Bethabara to
Cana. 3. From Cana to
Capernaum. 4. From
Capernaum to Jerusalem
and Judea. 5. From Judea
to Sychar, and thence to
Cana.</p>

<p>IV. We place in order
next the <b>Events</b> of the
Saviour's life during this
period.</p>

<p>1. <b>The first followers.</b>
Read John 1. 35-51 and
ascertain the names of
four, with hints of two
others; for one of two in
ver. 40 was John, and the
language in ver. 41 implies that each sought his own brother.
Notice what traits of character each disciple showed. In this
little company, the band out of which grew the Christian Church,
we find: 1.) A man who brought people one by one to Jesus.
2.) A deep, spiritually-minded mystic. 3.) A born leader. 4.) A
plain, simple-minded believer. 5.) A man of pure, spotless character.
What a combination of qualities for the founding of a church!</p>

<p>2. <b>The first miracle</b> (John 2. 1-11). In this miracle we find
an apt symbol of what Christ came to do among men. He found
water, and he turned it into living, spirit-quickening wine.</p>

<p>3. <b>The visit to Capernaum</b> (John 2. 12). Why he went we
have no means of knowing, and it is idle to speculate.</p>

<p>4. <b>The first Passover</b> (John 2. 13). The mention of these passovers
is important, for they enable us to know how long was the ministry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of Jesus, and they give us dates for its events. This was the
first passover of his ministry, not of his life.</p>

<p>5. <b>Cleansing the Temple</b> (John 2. 14-17). This was the first
public act of his ministry in which he claimed the authority of
Messiah in the house of God. See the prophecy, Mal. 3. 1-3. At
the close of his ministry he found that the same evils had crept again
into the temple, and purged it a second time (Matt. 21. 12).</p>

<p>6. <b>Conversation with Nicodemus</b> (<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'John 3. 1, 21'">John 3. 1-21</ins>). This conversation
was remarkable: 1.) From the rank and character of the man
(Vers. 3, 10). 2.) From the theme (Ver. 3.) 3). From its results
(John 7. 50; 19. 39).</p>

<p>7. <b>Ministry in Judea</b> (John 3. 22.) 1.) Its precise place is unknown.
2.) Its relation to John the Baptist (John 3. 26). 3.) Its
success (John 4. 1).</p>

<p>8. <b>Ministry in Samaria</b> (John 4. 4-42). 1.) What led to it.
(Ver. 4.) 2.) Where it took place. (Ver. 5.) 3.) How it began. (Vers.
6, 7.) 4.) Its first convert, a remarkable character, of aptness in
speech, penetration, and power to influence others. (Vers. 9, 15, 20,
25, 28, 30, 39.) Compare her brightness with the dullness of Nicodemus.
5.) Its length. (Ver. 40.) 6.) Its results: (Vers. 41,42.)
This ministry is a most interesting episode in the life of Jesus.</p>

<p>9. <b>Return to Galilee</b> (John 4. 43). 1.) Reason for the journey
(John 4. 1-3). 2.) Another reason (Mark 1. 14). 3.) Still another
reason (John 4. 44, 45)&mdash;that is, he had no honor in his own country
until he had obtained it in Judea.</p>

<p>10. <b>Healing the nobleman's son</b> (John 4. 46-54). 1.) Where
Jesus was. (Ver. 46.) 2.) Who the man was. (Ver. 46)&mdash;literally, "a
king's man, courtier." Is his name given in Luke 8. 30? 3.) His
spirit, earnestness, persistence, faith. (Vers. 48-50.) 4.) His reward.
(Vers. 51, 52.) 5.) Result of the miracle. (Ver. 53.)</p>

<p>Let the student, 1.) Commit this series to memory. 2.) Study
the facts in relation to each by searching out the references.
3.) Recall the facts in connection with each event. 4.) Make a list
of eight men and two women who were connected with these
events and recall what is related of each person.</p>

<p>V. Let us now consider the <b>General Traits of the Ministry of
Christ</b> during this period.</p>

<p>1. It was <b>preparatory</b>. So far as we can perceive, the plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of Christ's kingdom were not as yet revealed, and no general proclamation
of it was made. Yet he clearly revealed himself to a
chosen few as the Messiah of Israel (John 1. 41, 45: 4. 25, 26).</p>

<p>2. <b>It was connected with John the Baptist.</b> The two streams
of John's ministry and Christ's ministry run together during this
preparatory ministry. John introduced Jesus (John 1. 29-36).
The two worked at the same time, in the same way, and not far
apart (John 3. 22-24). Both Jesus and John refused to be put into
a relation of rivalry, either by their friends (John 3. 25-30) or by
their enemies (John 4. 1-3).</p>

<p>3. It was <b>individual</b>&mdash;that is, to individuals rather than to
masses of people. We read of no such multitudes as in the succeeding
period, but we find six conversations of Jesus with single
persons or small groups. He sought to gather a few choice disciples
rather than many adherents.</p>

<p>4. It was a <b>teaching</b> ministry. There were miracles (John 2.
23; 3. 2), but they were not made prominent; and the immediate
followers of Jesus were won by what they saw in him and heard
from him rather than by wonders wrought by him.</p>

<p>VI. Lastly, we ascertain the <b>Results</b> of the Saviour's ministry
during this period.</p>

<p>1. It gave him <b>prominence before the people</b>. The popular
attention was arrested, and there was a transient, superficial acceptance
by the many; but Jesus knew the hearts of men too well to
trust them (John 2. 23, 24; 3. 26).</p>

<p>2. It led to his <b>rejection by the rulers</b>. Though this is not stated
it is hinted at in the controversies of the Jewish leaders (John 2. 18);
in the conclusion of the gospel writer (John 3. 18-20), and in the
reference to the Pharisees (John 4. 1). From this hour the attitude
of the capital and the ruling minds was hostile to Jesus. They
missed the one great opportunity in their nation's history.</p>

<p>3. It drew around him <b>chosen followers</b>. From this time there
was a company of disciples with Jesus. They returned to their
homes in Galilee for a time, but were soon called to leave all and
accompany their master. To some of them we find three separate
calls (John 1. 37-42; Matt. 4. 18-22 more than a year later, and
Mark 3. 13, 14, later still).</p>

<p>4. <b>It prepared for his ministry in Galilee.</b> The fame of Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
acts in Judea went before him to Galilee, awakened curiosity, and
gave him a ready reception on his return (John 4. 45). We shall
find in the next period great multitudes thronging after Jesus as the
result of his ministry in Judea.</p>

<h2>SIXTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Year of Popularity</div>

<h3>From the Rejection at Nazareth to the Discourse on the Bread
of Life</h3>


<p>I. <b>General Aspects of the Ministry of Christ during the Period.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>Its Time.</b> It was either a little less or a little more than a
year, according to different authorities. According to Dr. Edersheim
it extended from May, A. D. 28, to April, A. D. 29; according
to Dr. Andrews, from March, A. D. 28, to April, A. D. 29.</p>

<p>2. <b>Its Locality.</b> The principal sphere of Christ's activity during
this year was Galilee, though he made one visit to Jerusalem (John
5. 1).</p>

<p>3. <b>Its Aim.</b> The purpose of Jesus during this year seems to
have been to proclaim the new kingdom of God as widely as possible,
and to make men acquainted with its principles. The theme of
his preaching is given in Matt. 4. 17. The deeper themes of the
Gospel were reserved for a later time and a select body of hearers;
and those aspects were presented which all men could at once comprehend,
as the teaching in the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p>4. <b>Its Activity.</b> No other year in the Saviour's life was crowded
so thickly with journeys and labors. See its summary in Matt. 4.
23-25. We can trace eight distinct journeys from Capernaum to
various regions during this year.</p>

<p>5. <b>Its Divisions.</b> The number of events left on record makes a
subdivision of this period necessary, and we find a convenient place
at the Sermon on the Mount, which marks a point of departure in
the Saviour's ministry. The <b>Early Galilean Ministry</b> extends from
the rejection at Nazareth to the Sermon on the Mount, and the
<b>Later Galilean Ministry</b> from the Sermon on the Mount to the discourse
on the Bread of Life. During the earlier section the ministry
was personal and the range was less extended; during the later Jesus
sent his apostles forth to labor, and his own journeys were longer
and in new fields.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>II. <b>The Places.</b> Though the Saviour visited many places during
this year only seven have been named in the gospels. These
are:</p>

<p>1. <b>Capernaum</b>, his home during the period (Matt. 4. 15). From
this place he went forth on all of his preaching tours, and to it he
returned. Its privilege (Matt. 11. 23, 24). It was situated on the
northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p>2. <b>Nazareth.</b> Twice in this period Jesus was at this place: at
its beginning (Luke 4. 16), and again in the middle of the year
(Matt. 13. 54). On both occasions he was rejected by the people
(Luke 4. 28, 29; Matt. 13. 57).</p>

<p>3. <b>Nain.</b> This was a city southwest of the Sea of Galilee,
where Jesus restored a young man to life (Luke 7. 11).</p>

<p>4. <b>The Mountain.</b> A few miles from Capernaum and west of the
Sea of Galilee is a mountain (probably Kurun Hattin, "the horns
of Hattin") where was delivered the Sermon on the Mount (Matt.
5. 1).</p>

<p>5. <b>Bethsaida</b>, a place on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee,
east of the river Jordan. Near this was wrought the miracle of
Feeding the Five Thousand (Mark 6. 45).</p>

<p>6. <b>Gergesa.</b> A place on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee,
called also <b>Gerasa</b> (Mark 5. 1; Luke 8. 26. Rev. Ver.).</p>

<p>7. <b>Jerusalem.</b> We read of one visit to the capital during this
period (John 5. 1).</p>

<p>III. <b>The Early Galilean Ministry.</b></p>

<p>1.) <b>The Journeys.</b> Combining the accounts in the four gospels
we find that the journeys were the following:</p>

<p>2.) <b>The Settlement at Capernaum</b> (Cana to Nazareth and Capernaum).
From Cana, where Jesus was at the close of the preceding
period, he went to Nazareth (Luke 4. 16), probably intending to
begin his ministry there; but being rejected went down to Capernaum
and made it the headquarters of his ministry (Luke 4. 30, 31).</p>

<p>3.) <b>Tour in Eastern Galilee</b> (Capernaum, Eastern Galilee, and
return). From Capernaum Jesus went forth on a preaching tour
through the villages near the Sea of Galilee (Luke 4. 43, 44).</p>

<p>4.) <b>A Visit to Jerusalem</b> (Capernaum to Jerusalem and return).
Mention is made in John 5. 1 of a feast in Jerusalem which Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
attended, but it is uncertain whether Passover, Tabernacles, or
Purim is meant.</p>

<p>5.) <b>The Mountain Journey</b> (Capernaum to the mountain and
return). For the purpose of quiet meditation and the call of his
apostles Jesus went to a mountain near the Sea of Galilee. There
he chose the twelve and gave to them and the multitudes around
the Sermon on the Mount (Mark 3. 13, 14; Matt. 5. 1).</p>

<a href="images/i044-big.jpg"><img src="images/i044.jpg" width="272" height="300" alt="map: YEAR OF POPULARITY, PART ONE" /></a>
</div>

<p>IV. <b>Events of the Early Galilean Ministry.</b></p>

<p>1.) With the first Journey, the <i>Settlement at Capernaum</i>, we
connect the following events:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p><div class='blockquot'><p>1. <b>The Rejection at Nazareth</b> (Luke 4. 16-30).</p>

<p>2. <b>The First Disciples Called</b> (Luke 5. 1-11). They had
already been followers of Jesus, but now were called upon
to leave their homes and become his disciples.</p>

<p>3. <b>Miracles at Capernaum</b> (Mark 1. 21-34). The gospel
writers select the scenes of one day and show many miracles,
in the synagogue, at Peter's house, and in the street.</p></div>

<p>2.) With the Second Journey, the <i>Tour in Eastern Galilee</i>, we
find two events named:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>4. <b>Healing of the Leper</b> (Mark 1. 40-45). This took place
during the journey.</p>

<p>5. <b>Healing the Paralytic</b> (Mark 2. 1-12). This took place
after the return to Capernaum.</p></div>

<p>3.) With the Third Journey, the <i>Visit to Jerusalem</i>, we note
two events:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>6. <b>The Miracle at Bethesda</b> (John 5. 1-16). Read this in
the Rev. Ver. and note what is omitted. Observe
also what resulted from this miracle in Jerusalem
(John 5. 16-19).</p>

<p>7. <b>The Withered Hand</b> (Mark 3. 1-6). This probably took
place at Capernaum, soon after the return from Jerusalem.</p></div>

<p>4.) With the Fourth, the <i>Mountain Journey</i>, we note two
events:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>8. <b>The Call of the Twelve</b> (Mark 3. 7-19). This was at the
mountain.</p>

<p>9. <b>Sermon on the Mount</b> (Matt. 5-7). This sermon is
omitted in Mark and abbreviated in Luke, but
reported fully in Matthew.</p></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To the Teacher</b></div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1. Let the outline of the lesson be committed to memory.</p>

<p>2. Let one scholar draw the maps in presence of the class, another insert
the places, a third indicate and name the journeys.</p>

<p>3. Then let one scholar name all the events with the first journey; another
the events of the second journey, etc.</p>

<p>4. Let a scholar be called upon to tell the story of each one of the nine
events in the period.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>We now take up the second part of the Year of Popularity, from
the Sermon on the Mount to the Discourse on the Bread of Life.</p>

<p>V. <b>The Journeys of the Later Galilean Ministry.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>Tour in Southern Galilee</b> (Capernaum to Nain and return).
From Capernaum Jesus led his disciples southward as far as Nain
(Luke 7. 1, 11). There he wrought a miracle, and on the journey
homeward preached in various places (Luke 8. 1).</p>

<p>2. <b>The Voyage to Gergesa.</b> (Capernaum to Gergesa and return.)
With his disciples Jesus sailed across the Sea of Galilee (Luke 8. 22),
stilling the tempest on the way. They landed at Gergesa, in the
country of the Gadarenes (Luke 8. 26)&mdash;that is, not far from the
well-known city of Gadara, which was twenty miles from the Sea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Galilee. Here the Gadarene demoniac was restored, but the people
were unwilling to receive Jesus, so he sailed back to Capernaum
(Matt. 9. 1.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i047-big.jpg"><img src="images/i047.jpg" width="400" height="389" alt="map: YEAR OF POPULARITY, PART TWO." /></a>
</div>

<p>3. <b>Tour in Central Galilee</b> (Capernaum to Nazareth and return).
The object of this journey was a second visit to Nazareth (Mark 6.
1), but, like the first, it was unsuccessful; so Jesus left "his own
country" and preached in the villages of central Galilee (Mark 6. 6).</p>

<p>4. <b>Retirement to Bethsaida</b> (Capernaum, Bethsaida, and return).
In order to obtain needed rest and seclusion Jesus and his disciples
sailed across the lake to the unsettled country near Bethsaida (Mark
6. 31, 32). Here he wrought the miracle of Feeding the Five
Thousand, recrossed the lake in the night, and a day or two afterward
gave his last discourse of the Galilean ministry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Let the pupil draw the same map as with Part One, but omitting
the journeys of that part; and place upon the maps the journeys of
the later Galilean ministry.</p>

<p>VI. <b>The Events of the Later Galilean Ministry.</b></p>

<p>1.) With the First Journey, the <i>Tour in Southern Galilee</i>:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) <b>The Widow's Son Raised</b> (Luke 7. 11-16). This took
place at Nain, southwest of the Sea of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Gaililee'">Galilee</ins>.</p>

<p>2.) <b>Washing the Saviour's Feet</b> (Luke 7. 36-50). This event
is to be carefully distinguished from the "anointing by Mary,"
much later in the history.</p></div>

<p>These two events are related only by Luke.</p>

<p>2.) With the Second Journey, the <i>Voyage to Gergesa</i>:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>3.) <b>Parables by the Sea</b> (Mark 4. 1-34; also in Matt. 13. 1-52).
These were given just before the journey.</p>

<p>4.) <b>Stilling the Tempest</b> (Mark 4. 1-35-41).</p>

<p>5.) <b>The Gadarene Demoniac Restored</b> (Mark 5. 1-20).</p>

<p>6.) <b>Jairus's Daughter Raised</b> (Mark 5. 21-43). Two miracles
wrought after the return from the Gadarene country.</p></div>

<p>3.) With the third Journey, the <i>Tour in Central Galilee</i>.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>7.) <b>Second Rejection at Nazareth</b> (Mark 6. 1-6). Compare
with this the account of his former rejection, and note the
differences.</p>

<p>8.) <b>Sending out the Twelve</b> (Mark 6. 7-13). Read the longer
report of the charge to the Twelve in Matt. 10.</p></div>

<p>4.) With the Fourth Journey, the <i>Retirement to Bethsaida</i>:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>9.) <b>Feeding the Five Thousand</b> (Mark 6. 31-44). This and
the following are the only miracles related in all the four
gospels. Compare their accounts.</p>

<p>10.) <b>Walking on the Sea</b> (Mark 6. 45-52). Note the additions
in Matt. 14. 22-33).</p>

<p>11.) <b>Discourse on the Bread of Life</b> (John 6. 24-59). This
marked a crisis in his ministry, for it proclaimed a spiritual
application of the miracle, and not a "kingdom of meat and
drink," as men were expecting. Note the results (John 6.
60-68). Thus at the close of his Galilean ministry&mdash;as before
at the close of his Judean ministry&mdash;the Saviour was left
alone with his few disciples.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h2>SEVENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Year of Opposition</div>

<h3>From the Retirement to Ph&oelig;nicia to the Anointing by Mary</h3>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Part One</span></div>

<p>I. <b>General Aspects of the Period.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>It was a year, lacking one week.</b> Jesus did not attend the
third passover of his ministry. We find him at this time still in
Galilee, and soon afterward leaving Galilee for "the coasts of Tyre
and Sidon" (John 7. 1-3; Mark 7. 24). Nearly a year later, on the
week before the fourth passover, we find Jesus at Bethany, where
the anointing by Mary took place (John 12. 1, 2). Between these
two passovers came the year of opposition.</p>

<p>2. <b>It was a year of wandering.</b> During this period we notice
that Jesus was in constant motion, staying only a little while at
each place, and in succession visiting all the five provinces of Palestine.
Notice the province referred to in each of the following <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'refences'">references</ins>:
John 7. 1; Mark 7. 31; Mark 8. 27; Luke 9. 51, 52; Mark 10.
1; John 10. 40.</p>

<p>3. <b>It was a year of retirement.</b> We do not find that Jesus sought
the multitudes during this year, though in new places he was sought
by them (Luke 11. 29; 12. 1). He seems to have chosen most of the
time a secluded life, preferring to be alone with his disciples.
See instances in Mark 7. 24, 32, 33, 36; 8. 22, 23, 26; 9. 30.</p>

<p>4. <b>It was a year of instruction.</b> He chose to be alone with his
disciples, knowing that he was rapidly nearing the close of his life
on earth; and he wished to instruct his chosen followers in the deeper
truths of the gospel before he should be taken from them. His
teaching in this period presented the spiritual side of truth and the
doctrines of the cross. Notice how often during this year he foretold
his own death (Mark 8. 31; 9. 31, 32; 10. 32-34; John 12.
7, 8).</p>

<p>5. <b>It was a year of opposition.</b> Nearly all the people had now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
forsaken Jesus and turned against him. Note the attitude of the
Pharisees. (Matt 12. 23, 24, 38, 39; 23. 23.) The Sadducees, who were
the office-holding class, are mainly referred to in John 11. 47, 48, 53.
The attitude of the people. (John 6. 66.) Jesus was now rejected
by the rulers, the leaders of the religious class, and by the people.</p>

<p>II. <b>The Localities of the Period.</b> Beside the five <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'provincess'">provinces</ins>,
Judea, Samaria, Galilee, Bashan and Peræa, two other lands or
districts are named:</p>

<p>1. <b>Ph&oelig;nicia</b>, called in the gospels "the borders of Tyre and
Sidon," narrow strip of territory between Mount Lebanon and
the Mediterranean Sea, northwest of Palestine.</p>

<p>2. <b>Decapolis.</b> The word means "ten cities," and refers to a
region, partly in Bashan and partly in Peræa, wherein were ten
important cities, not Jewish but Gentile.</p>

<p>In addition to the above we meet with names of eight cities:</p>

<p>3. <b>Cæsarea Philippi</b>, at the foot of Mount Hermon, in the province
of Bashan.</p>

<p>4. <b>Bethsaida</b>, on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p>5. <b>Capernaum</b>, on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p>6. <b>Bethabara</b>, in the Jordan Valley, east of the river, south of the
Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p>7. <b>Jericho</b>, in the Jordan Valley, west of the river, near the head
of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>8. <b>Jerusalem</b>, the capital.</p>

<p>9. <b>Bethany</b>, two miles east of Jerusalem, on the eastern slope
of the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>10. <b>Ephraim</b>, or Ephron, fourteen miles north of Jerusalem,
among the mountains.</p>

<p>III. <b>The Journeys and Events of the Period.</b> The information
upon this year is meager, and it is impossible to arrange its places
and facts with absolute certainty. No other period is so uncertain
in the order of its events as this. We trace in this period nine
journeys; and with each journey call attention to the most important
events connected with it. The first journey begins at Capernaum.</p>

<p>1. <b>A Visit to Ph&oelig;nicia.</b> (From Capernaum to Ph&oelig;nicia.) (Matt.
15. 21). This was the only land outside of Palestine visited by
Jesus, and it is uncertain how far he entered within its limits. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
sought retirement and opportunity of instructing his disciples
(Mark 7. 24).</p>

<p>On this journey was wrought the miracle on the <b>Syrophenician
Woman's Daughter</b> (Mark 7. 25, 26), in which Jesus showed his disciples
that Gentiles may have true faith.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 277px;">
<a href="images/i052-big.jpg"><img src="images/i052.jpg" width="277" height="400" alt="map: YEAR OF OPPOSITION." /></a>
</div>

<p>2. <b>A Visit to Decapolis.</b> Finding seclusion impossible he
went around Galilee to Decapolis, east of the Sea of Galilee (Mark
7. 31).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Here two miracles were wrought: 1.) <b>Healing the Deaf Man.</b>
Notice its peculiarities in Mark 7. 32-37. 2.) <b>Feeding the Four
Thousand</b> (Mark 8. 1-9). Notice its differences from a former
miracle in the preceding period.</p>

<p>3. <b>A Visit to Cæsarea Philippi.</b> (Decapolis to Dalmanutha,
Bethsaida, and Cæsarea Philippi.) Trace the route from Mark 8.
10, 22, 27.</p>

<p>During this journey <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'occured'">occurred</ins> four events: 1.) <b>Healing the Blind
Man</b> (Mark 8. 22-26). This was at Bethsaida. 2.) <b>Peter's Confession</b>
(Matt. 16. 13-20). 3.) <b>The Transfiguration</b> (Mark 9. 2-8).
4.) <b>Healing the Demoniac Boy</b> (Mark 9. 14-29). These three
events were at Cæsarea Philippi.</p>

<p>4. <b>A Visit to Capernaum.</b> (Cæsarea Philippi to Capernaum.)
(Mark 9. 33). Notice that his coming was unattended by the crowds
of former times (Mark 9. 33). This visit is noteworthy as his farewell
to the city which had been his home.</p>

<p>On this visit took place the touching incident of the <b>Child in the
Midst</b> (Mark 9. 36, 37).</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Part Two</span></div>

<p>5. <b>A Visit to Jerusalem.</b> (Capernaum, through Samaria, to
Jerusalem.) See Luke 9. 51, 52. His visit to the capital was for
the purpose of attending the Feast of Tabernacles (John 7. 2, 10, 14)
and he seems to have remained until the Feast of Dedication, two
months later.</p>

<p>In connection with this visit note, 1.) <b>The Rejection by Samaritans</b>
(Luke 9. 52-56). 2.) <b>Mary and Martha</b> (Luke 10. 38-42). 3.)
<b>The Pool of Siloam</b> (John 9. 1-7). 4.) <b>The Good Shepherd</b> (John
10. 1-18).</p>

<p>6. <b>A Visit to Bethabara.</b> (Jerusalem to Bethabara.) From
the Feast of Dedication Jesus went down to Bethabara, evidently
with the purpose of beginning a ministry in Peræa (John 10. 39, 40).</p>

<p>With this journey we place <b>Sending out the Seventy</b> (Luke 10.
1). These messengers were sent out to prepare for the visit of Jesus
to a new province.</p>

<p>7. <b>A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'visit'">Visit</ins> to Bethany</b> (John 11. 1, 7.) From Bethabara Jesus
was suddenly called to Bethany, near Jerusalem (John 11. 18).</p>

<p>With this visit we place the <b>Raising of Lazarus</b> (John 11. 1-46),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a miracle narrated only by John, and told because it led directly to
the conspiracy against the life of Jesus (John 11. 47, 48).</p>

<p>8. <b>A Visit to Peræa.</b> (From Bethany to Ephraim and Peræa.)
Trace the journey from John 11. 54, and Mark 10. 1. Jesus stayed
some months in Peræa, preaching to his people.</p>

<p>Many events might be given with this Peræan ministry, of which
we name only, 1.) <b>Blessing the Children</b> (Mark 10. 13-16). 2.)
<b>The Rich Young Ruler</b> (Mark 10. 17-25). 3.) <b>Parable of the Prodigal
Son</b> (Luke 15. 11-32).</p>

<p>9. <b>A Second Visit to Bethany.</b> (From Peræa, through Jericho,
to Bethany.) Notice the journey in Mark 10. 32, 46; John 12. 1.</p>

<p>With this journey notice the events, 1.) <b>The Healing of Bartimæus</b>
(Mark 10. 46, 52). 2.) <b>The Visit to Zacchæus</b> (Luke 19. 1-10).
3.) <b>The Anointing by Mary</b> (John 12. 1-8). This brings the life of
Christ within one week of the Crucifixion, and completes the period.</p>

<h2>EIGHTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Week of the Passion</div>

<h3>From the Triumphal Entry Until the Agony in the Garden</h3>


<p>I. <b>General View of the Period.</b></p>

<p>1. Our studies have now reached the close of the Saviour's ministry
and have brought us to his <b>last visit to Jerusalem</b>. This
period presents the last appeal of Jesus to the Jewish people and
his final conversations with his disciples before his death.</p>

<p>2. Strictly speaking, "the week of the passion" or suffering of
Jesus should include all the events from his Triumphal Entry into
Jerusalem on Sunday until his burial on Friday evening. But the
events of the day of his crucifixion were so many and so important
as to make that day a period by itself, and we therefore consider
at present only <b>five days</b>, from the Sunday morning to the Thursday
night of the Jewish Passover, the night before the Saviour's
crucifixion.</p>

<p>3. All its events took place in or <b>near Jerusalem</b>. On each
morning Jesus went from Bethany, where he remained at night with
his friends, the household of Mary and Martha; and on each evening
except the last he returned to Bethany. The days were mostly
spent in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>II. In the study of this period we note the following <b>Places</b>:</p>

<p>1. <b>Bethany</b>, a small village on the eastern slope of the Mount of
Olives. It was the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus (John 11.
1). Its distance from Jerusalem (John 11. 18). The lodging place
of Jesus at this time (Matt. 21. 17).</p>

<p>2. <b>The Temple</b> in Jerusalem. Here Jesus passed most of the
time during the first three days of this week in discussion with the
Jews (Luke 21. 37). The part of the temple in which Jesus taught
(John 8. 20; Mark 12. 41). This was the Court of the Women,
called "the treasury" because of boxes for contributions upon
its walls. It was inside the larger Court of the Gentiles, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
about two hundred and thirty feet square, open above to the sky,
but with galleries around.</p>

<p>3. <b>The Supper room.</b> See Mark 14. 13-17. The place is unknown;
but there is on Mount Zion a locality pointed out by tradition
which may or may not be correct. This was probably the
"upper room" used as a meeting place after the Resurrection and
Ascension (John 20. 19; Acts 1. 13; 2. 1).</p>

<p>4. <b>The Mount of Olives.</b> This is a range of hills east of Jerusalem
and separated from the Temple by the Valley of the Kedron
(John 18. 1). Its distance from the city (Acts 1. 12). Here began
the Triumphal Entry (Luke 19. 37). From this height Jesus gave
his prophecy of the destruction of the city (Mark 13. 3, 4).</p>

<p>5. <b>The Garden of Gethsemane.</b> The word means "oil-press,"
and suggests that it was an olive orchard on the western slope of the
Mount of Olives (Mark 14. 26, 32). A garden is still shown which
may be the true locality of the Agony.</p>

<p>Let the student draw a map of Jerusalem and its surroundings
and locate upon it the above places, not failing to search out the
references and associate the events with their localities.</p>

<p>III. We draw on our map and fix in our memory the following
<b>Journeys</b>:</p>

<p>1. <b>On Sunday, the First Journey; from Bethany to the Temple
and Return.</b> On the first day of the week Jesus left Bethany, entered
in triumphal procession into Jerusalem, looked around on the
Temple, and at evening returned to Bethany.</p>

<p>2. <b>On Monday, the Second Journey; from Bethany to the Temple
and Return.</b> Early in the morning, without waiting for breakfast,
Jesus left Bethany (Mark 11. 12), and crossed the ridge of the
Mount of Olives, on the way cursing the barren fig tree. He cleansed
the Temple of its traders, and at evening returned again to Bethany
(Mark 11. 19).</p>

<p>3. <b>On Tuesday, the Third Journey; from Bethany to the Temple
and Return.</b> This was the last day of Christ's public teaching, closing
with a terrible denunciation of the Scribes and Pharisees.
Toward evening he went out of the Temple for the last time, sat
upon the Mount of Olives with his disciples, and gave to them his
prediction of the destruction of the city (Mark 13. 1-4).</p>

<p>4. <b>On Thursday afternoon, the Fourth Journey; from Bethany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to the Supper room.</b> Take notice that no journey or event is
named by any evangelist as taking place on Wednesday. Probably
the day was passed in seclusion and meditation, for no conversations
with disciples are recorded. On Thursday afternoon Jesus
with his disciples left Bethany and walked over the mountain and
the valley to Jerusalem (Mark 14. 16, 17), where they celebrated
the passover and partook of the Last Supper together. Afterward
came the long conversations recorded in John 13 to 17.</p>

<p>5. <b>On Thursday, at about midnight, the Fifth Journey; from
the Supper room to Gethsemane.</b> The Saviour and his eleven disciples
went from the supper room into the silent streets of Jerusalem,
through the gate, and into the valley of Kedron. They crossed
the brook and entered the Garden of Gethsemane, where the Agony
took place, and immediately after it the Arrest (John 18. 1).</p>

<p>IV. We now pass in order the <b>Events</b> of these five days:</p>

<p>1. <b>The Triumphal Entry.</b> (Sunday.) (Mark 11. 1-10.) Compare
the accounts and note the additions made by John. (John
12. 12-16.)</p>

<p>2. <b>The Barren Fig tree.</b> (Monday.) (Mark 11. 12-14.) This
was not a wanton or petulant act of cursing. The tree was a vivid
picture of the Jewish state, bearing leaves but no fruit, and the miracle
was wrought as a warning of impending doom.</p>

<p>3. <b>Cleansing the Temple.</b> (Monday.) (Mark 11. 15-17.) Once
before, in the beginning of his ministry, Jesus had purged the Temple
(John 2. 13-16). But the former abuses had crept in again,
and Christ again proclaimed his authority in his Father's house.</p>

<p>4. <b>The Last Discourses.</b> (Tuesday.) (Mark 11. 27; 12. 44.)
On this day Jesus met and vanquished in debate successively the
rulers (Mark 11. 27-33); the Pharisees (Mark 12. 1-12; Matt. 21. 45);
the Herodians (Mark 12. 13-17); the Sadducees (Mark 12. 18-27);
and the scribes (Mark 12. 28-37). He closed his ministry with a
rebuke to the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 23. 1-39); and after
commending the gift of the widow (Mark 12. 41-44) went out of
the Temple, never to return (Mark 13. 1, 2.)</p>

<p>5. <b>The Prophecy of the Last Things.</b> (Tuesday.) In the afternoon
of that day Jesus sat with his disciples on the Mount of Olives,
and looking down upon the city gave a prophecy to his disciples,
mingling the predictions of the city's overthrow and of the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the world (Mark 13. 1-37). In Matthew are added two parables&mdash;the
Ten Virgins (Matt. 25. 1-13), and the Talents (Matt. 25. 14-30),
and also the description of the Last Judgment (Matt. 25. 31-46).</p>

<p>6. <b>The Retirement at Bethany.</b> (Wednesday.) Inasmuch as
none of the gospels mention any event of Wednesday we assume
that the day was passed in retirement.</p>

<p>7. <b>The Last Supper.</b> (Thursday.) On the afternoon of Thursday
Jesus went to Jerusalem with the Twelve, partook of the Passover,
and at its close instituted the Lord's Supper (Mark 14. 12-31).</p>

<p>8. <b>The Last Conversation.</b> (Thursday evening.) (John 14 to 18.)
After the Supper the long conversation took place recorded in full
by John, and scarcely mentioned in the other gospels.</p>

<p>9. <b>The Agony in the Garden.</b> (Thursday, midnight.) Late at
night Jesus crossed the brook Kedron and entered the Garden of
Gethsemane, where the Agony came upon him (Mark 14. 32-42).</p>

<h2>NINTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Day of the Crucifixion</div>

<h3>From the Betrayal to the Burial of Jesus</h3>


<p>I. <b>General View of the Period.</b></p>

<p>1. This period embraces the events of but <b>one day</b> in the life of
Jesus. It was the day following the Passover Day, and therefore the
fifteenth of the month Nisan, in the Jewish year. See Num. 28. 16.</p>

<p>The betrayal of Jesus took place a little after midnight, on Friday
morning, and the burial about sunset on the same day; so that
the transactions of the period include about eighteen hours.</p>

<p>2. It was, however, <b>an eventful day</b> in the life of Jesus. No day
in all Bible story is narrated with the fullness of this day. Nearly
one-twelfth of the matter in the four gospels is occupied with the
account of this one day. If the whole story of Christ's life were
written out with equal completeness to this one day's record it
would require more than four hundred volumes as large as the New
Testament.</p>

<p>3. It was an <b>important day</b>; the most important in the history
of the world. Notice in the epistles how much more is said of the
death of Christ than of his life. See 1 Cor. 2. 2; Gal. 6. 14; 1 John
1. 7. Because of its eventfulness and importance we should give
it careful study and place in order its events as a separate period in
the life of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>II. <b>The Places.</b> All these are in or near Jerusalem; but none
of them can be identified with certainty. Yet it is well to know
the traditional localities and to fix them upon the map of the city.
There are five places named in the story of this day.</p>

<p>1. <b>The Garden of Gethsemane.</b> Here Jesus was arrested, immediately
after the agony (Mark 14. 43). See the mention of this
locality in the last study.</p>

<p>2. <b>The High Priest's House</b> (Mark 14. 53, 54). The high priest
at that time was Caiaphas, but his father-in-law, Annas, who had
been deposed by the Romans, was still regarded by the Jews as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
legitimate priest, and possessed great authority. There was no
special "palace" of the high priest, and Annas and Caiaphas may
have lived in the same group of buildings. The place is located
by tradition on Mount Zion, near that of the supper room.</p>

<p>3. <b>Pilate's Palace</b> (Mark 15. 1-16). The Roman capital of Judea
was not in Jerusalem, but at Cæsarea, where the procurator resided
(Acts 23. 23, 24). But it was customary for the governor to visit
Jerusalem at the time of Passover, in order to quell any disturbance
at that time, when the city was thronged. Pilate may
have made his headquarters in Jerusalem either in the castle of
Antonia, north of the temple (referred to in Acts 21. 34, and elsewhere),
or in the palace of Herod the Great on the northwest corner
of Mount Zion, the place now occupied by the (so-called) Tower of
David. The latter locality is accepted by the best of the recent
authorities. Here Jesus was brought for his trial and sentence by
Pontius Pilate.</p>

<p>4. <b>Herod's Palace.</b> At that time Herod Antipas, tetrarch of
Galilee and Peræa (Luke 3. 1), the slayer of John the Baptist, was
present in Jerusalem attending the Passover, and to him Jesus was
sent by Pilate (Luke 23. 7). His abiding place was probably the
old Maccabean palace, about midway between the temple and
Pilate's headquarters.</p>

<p>5. <b>Calvary or Golgotha.</b> See Luke 23. 33 and Mark 15. 22 for
the two names, one of which is Greek, the other Hebrew, both meaning
"skull-like" or "the place of skulls." All positively known
about this place is that it was outside the wall, but near the city
(John 19. 20). Two localities are given: the traditional one, north
of Zion and west of the temple, now occupied by the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher; the other, recently coming into notice and accepted
by many scholars, a hill on the north of the city, containing a great
cave known as the "Grotto of Jeremiah." We adopt the latter
place as Calvary, although the evidence is by no means certain.
The place of the cross and that of the burial were in the same locality
(John 19. 41, 42).</p>

<p>It would be well for the student to draw a rough diagram showing
these places in their general relation to each other, as above.</p>

<p>III. We notice the <b>Journeys of Jesus</b> on the day of his
crucifixion.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <b>From Gethsemane to the High Priest's House.</b> From the
Garden of Gethsemane Jesus was taken to the high priest's house
for examination before Annas and Caiaphas (Luke 22. 54.)</p>

<p>2. <b>From the High Priest's House to Pilate's Palace.</b> After examination
before the high priests and the Jewish council Jesus was
led to Pilate for another trial (Luke 23. 1).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 287px;">
<a href="images/i062-big.jpg"><img src="images/i062.jpg" width="287" height="385" alt="map or diagram of Jesus' journey from Grethsamane to Calvary" /></a>
</div>

<p>3. <b>From Pilate's Palace to Herod's Palace and return.</b> Pilate
sent Jesus to Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee; but Herod was unwilling
to pass judgment upon him and sent him back (Luke 23.
7-11).</p>

<p>4. <b>From Pilate's Palace to Calvary.</b> At this second appearance
before Pilate Jesus was condemned to death, and was taken to
Calvary, outside the wall. Here he was crucified and after his death
was buried (John 19. 16, 17, 41).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Let the student draw on the diagram a line representing each of
these journeys and recall the events associated with them.</p>

<p>In Jerusalem, at the present time, there is a street known as Via
Dolorosa, "the Sorrowful Way," over which Jesus is believed to
have carried his cross from Pilate's judgment hall to Calvary. But
in our view both Pilate's judgment hall and Calvary are wrongly
located by tradition, and therefore this path cannot be the true
"way of the cross."</p>

<p>IV. <b>The Events.</b> We may group all the transactions of this
momentous day around eleven leading events:</p>

<p>1. <b>The Betrayal</b> (Mark 14. 43-50). This was in the Garden of
Gethsemane, a little after midnight, and, therefore, on Friday, the
15th of Nisan. See the more detailed account in John 18. 1-11.</p>

<p>2. <b>Jesus before Annas</b> (John 18. 12, 13). This was a preliminary
examination, and not official in its character.</p>

<p>3. <b>Jesus before Caiaphas</b> (John 18. 24). Read the account of
the event in Mark 14. 53-72. By comparing the four accounts we
find that there was first an examination before the high priest and
such of the council as could be gathered (Mark 14. 55), and then
later a trial before the entire Sanhedrin, or body of the elders (Luke
22. 66), at which Jesus was condemned to death. Peter's denial
took place in the house of the high priest (John 18. 24, 25).</p>

<p>4. <b>Jesus before Pilate.</b> The Jews had no power to sentence to
death, and hence were compelled to bring Jesus before Pilate (John
18. 28-32). Notice that the Jews condemned Jesus on one ground,
but accused him before Pilate on another (Matt. 26. 65, 66; Luke
23. 2). The dialogue of Pilate with Jesus is given in John 18. 29-37.
Pilate declared Christ's innocence and proposed that he
should be released, but the people still demanded that he should
be put to death.</p>

<p>5. <b>Jesus before Herod.</b> Pilate was unwilling to take the responsibility
either of putting to death an innocent man or of offending
the Jews by releasing him. He therefore sent him to Herod.
But Herod also refused to judge the case and after mocking Jesus
sent him back to Pilate (Luke 23. 6-11).</p>

<p>6. <b>Jesus Condemned to Death.</b> After Jesus was brought back
Pilate still endeavored to save his life. But instead of setting him
free at once as an innocent man he proposed to release him as an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of good feeling at the Passover festival. The Jews chose Barabbas
and rejected Jesus; and at last Pilate gave unwilling sentence that
Jesus should be crucified. He was then delivered to the soldiers to
be mocked and tortured (Luke 23. 13-25).</p>

<p>7. <b>Jesus Bearing his Cross.</b> On the way from Pilate's palace to
Calvary Jesus was compelled to carry one of the beams of his own
cross (John 19. 17). A part of the way his cross was carried by a
man named Simon, of Cyrene, in Africa (Mark 15. 21).</p>

<p>8. <b>Jesus on the Cross.</b> At Calvary Jesus was fastened to the
cross by nails through his hands and feet (Luke 23. 33; John 20. 25).
He was crucified at nine o'clock in the morning and lived until three
o'clock in the afternoon (Mark 15. 25-34). The stupefying potion
offered to him before he was crucified (Mark 15. 23). Note the
four versions of the superscription (Matt. 27. 37; Mark 15. 26; Luke
23. 38; John 19. 19). The witnesses (John 19. 25).</p>

<p>9. <b>The Seven Words from the Cross.</b> The first word (Luke 23.
34). The second word (John 19. 26, 27). The third word (Luke
23. 43). The fourth word (Matt. 27. 46). The fifth word (John
19. 28). The sixth word (John 19. 30). The seventh word (Luke
23. 46).</p>

<p>10. <b>The Death on the Cross.</b> The fact (Mark 15. 37). A remarkable
testimony (Mark 15. 39). A remarkable event (Matt. 27.
51-53). An evidence of his death (John 19. 32-35).</p>

<p>11. <b>The Burial.</b> Why the body was taken away (John 19. 31).
How it was obtained (John 19. 38). The preparation (John 19. 39,
40). The place of burial (Matt. 27. 59, 60). The witnesses (Matt.
27. 61). The sealing of the tomb (Matt. 27. 62-66).</p>

<h2>TENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Forty Days of Resurrection</div>

<h3>From the Resurrection to the Ascension of Christ</h3>


<p>I. <b>The Necessity of Christ's Resurrection.</b> Strange as the resurrection
may appear to men in general, and unexpected as it was
to the disciples of Jesus, it was the necessary completion of his
work on earth.</p>

<p>1. It was necessary <b>from the nature of Christ</b>. A divine man,
it was impossible that he should be held in the grave (Acts 2. 24).
His resurrection showed that he was the Son of God (Rom. 1. 4).</p>

<p>2. It was necessary <b>for the fulfillment of prophecy</b>. Jesus himself
declared that the prophecies pointed to his resurrection (Luke
24. 45, 46). The apostles constantly appealed to the Old Testament
prophecies (Acts 13. 34, 35; 26. 22, 23; 1 Cor. 15. 4).</p>

<p>3. It was necessary for the <b>work of redemption</b>. He lived as our
example, and he must appear before God as our high priest and
mediator (Rom. 4. 25; 8. 34; 1 Cor. 15. 17).</p>

<p>4. It was necessary for the <b>faith of the disciples</b>. If Christ had
not risen the world would never have heard of his life and the
church would never have existed (1 Cor. 15. 19, 20; 1 Pet. 1. 3).</p>

<p>5. It was necessary to <b>attest Christ's authority</b>. But for the
resurrection the name of Jesus could have possessed no more
weight than any other name. Raised from the dead he has all
power (Matt. 28. 18; Acts 13. 33; 17. 31).</p>

<p>6. It was necessary as a <b>pledge of our resurrection</b>. If Christ
rose we too shall rise (Acts 26. 23; 1 Cor. 15. 12, 20-23).</p>

<p>II. <b>The Fact of Christ's Resurrection.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>It was proved by the testimony of witnesses.</b> See Acts 1. 3;
2. 32. The conduct of the disciples before and after the resurrection
was in itself a proof. Before they were in sorrow (Mark 16. 10;
Luke 24. 17). Afterward they were glad (Luke 24. 52; John 20.
20). The Christian Church to-day is the best evidence; for without
the resurrection it could never have been established.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <b>It was effected by the power of God.</b> (Acts 3. 15; Rom. 8.
11; Eph. 1. 20). Jesus speaks of his own power in connection with
this (John 2. 19; 10. 18). The Holy Spirit is also mentioned as raising
Christ from the dead (1 Peter 3. 18).</p>

<p>3. It took place <b>on the first day of the week</b>. (Mark 16. 9). In
commemoration of this event the first day of the week was observed
by the early Church (Acts 20. 7; 1 Cor. 16. 2). The name given
to this day (Rev. 1. 10).</p>

<p>4. It took place on <b>the third day after his death</b>. The body of
Jesus was in the grave between thirty and thirty-six hours&mdash;from
sunset on Friday to daybreak on Sunday. But in the Jewish notation
of time this was three days (Luke 24. 46; Acts 10. 40; 1 Cor.
15. 4).</p>

<p>III. <b>The Ten Appearances of Jesus after his Resurrection.</b> It
is not easy, perhaps not possible, to harmonize precisely all the
accounts in the gospels and in 1 Cor. 15. 4-7. But the best
authorities unite in the following order of the manifestations of
Christ between the resurrection and the ascension:</p>

<p>1. <b>To Mary Magdalene</b> (Mark 16. 9). This was at the sepulcher,
very soon after the resurrection. Several women went to the
sepulcher, found it open, and were told by an angel that Jesus had
risen. They went to bear the news to the disciples (Mark 16. 1-8;
Matt. 28. 1-8; Luke 24. 1-10). Mary Magdalene returned after
the rest had gone and saw the risen Lord (John 20. 1-18). Notice
that this Mary is to be carefully distinguished from Mary of
Bethany, John 11. 2, and from the unnamed woman in Luke 7. 37.</p>

<p>2. <b>To the other women</b> (Matt. 28. 9). This was near the sepulcher,
a few minutes later than the first appearance. The names of
these women (Mark 16. 1; Luke 24. 10).</p>

<p>3. <b>To two disciples</b> (Luke 24. 13-32). The place where Jesus
was revealed (Luke 24. 13). The name of Luke's probable informant
(Luke 24. 18).</p>

<p>4. <b>To Peter</b> (Luke 24. 33, 34; 1 Cor. 15. 5). This was in Jerusalem.
What took place at this meeting has not been revealed.</p>

<p>5. <b>To ten disciples</b> (Luke 24. 36-43). Another account in John
20. 19-25. This was in the upper room in Jerusalem, where the
Last Supper had been partaken, and it was on the evening of the
day of resurrection.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <b>To eleven disciples</b> (John 20. 26-29). This was in the same
place a week later.</p>

<p>7. <b>To seven disciples</b> at the Sea of Galilee (John 21. 1-22). At
this interview Peter was reinstated in his apostleship.</p>

<p>8. <b>To five hundred disciples</b> (1 Cor. 15. 6). This was the official
manifestation of Christ appointed before his death (Matt. 26. 32; 28.
16). It took place "on the mountain" (Rev. Ver.), probably
where the Sermon on the Mount was preached. At this time the
great commission was given (Matt. 28. 18-20).</p>

<p>9. <b>To James</b> (1 Cor. 15. 7). Nothing is known about this meeting.
The relationship of James to Jesus (Mark 6. 3; Gal. 1. 19).
Allusions to him in Acts 15. 13; 21. 18. His epistle (James 1. 1).
Probably this appearance was in Jerusalem (Acts 1. 14).</p>

<p>10. <b>The Ascension</b> (Luke 24. 50-53; Acts 1. 9). This was at
Bethany, on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (Acts 1. 12).
The promise at his departure (Acts 1. 10, 11).</p>

<p>This list of appearances should be carefully memorized and the
place of each noted on the map, with its circumstances and events.</p>

<p>IV. <b>The Traits of the Risen Christ.</b> There were some respects
in which Jesus after his resurrection was the same as he had been
before; but there were also some essential differences.</p>

<p>1. <b>He was the very same Jesus.</b> It was not a spirit, a disembodied
ghost, which appeared to the disciples. He possessed personal
identity, and was the living one whom the disciples had known
before. See Luke 24. 39, 40; John 20. 27.</p>

<p>2. <b>He appeared only occasionally.</b> He did not come to remain
with his people, for it was better for them that he should go away
(John 16. 7). He manifested himself after his resurrection often
enough to strengthen faith, but not enough to lead his disciples
to lean upon his presence.</p>

<p>3. <b>He appeared to his disciples only</b> (Acts 10. 40, 41). Why he
did not appear to unbelievers (Luke 16. 31). His personal ministry
was ended, and henceforth he was to speak to men through
his messengers (2 Cor. 5. 19, 20).</p>

<p>4. <b>He possessed a spiritual body.</b> There is a spiritual body
(1 Cor. 15. 40-44). Christ possessed such a body, uncontrolled by
physical law, but dominated by the spirit. He came and went at
will (Luke 24. 36; John 20. 19). He withheld himself from recognition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
or permitted it as he chose (Luke 24. 15, 16; 24. 30, 31;
John 20. 14-16; 21. 4-7). With us the body limits the spirit; with
him the spirit controlled the body.</p>

<p>5. <b>He recognized individuals</b> after his resurrection. The grave
had not blotted out his memory of the past nor of his personal regard
for people. He called his friends by name after his resurrection
(Matt. 28. 10; John 20. 16; 20. 26; 21. 15). He showed the same
spirit of affection, of tenderness, and of patience with the mistakes
of his followers as he had shown during his earthly life. His gentleness
toward a sorrowing woman (John 20. 11-15). His kindness
toward a doubting disciple (John 20. 24-29). His forgiveness of a
denying disciple (John 21. 15-19). Such were the traits which he
bore away from earth, and such are the traits which he bears still
on his throne.</p>

<h2>ELEVENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The New Testament World</div>


<p>We have seen that the life of Jesus Christ while on earth was
limited to the land of Palestine. But in a few years the church
founded by his apostles overstepped the boundaries of that land;
and its scope became world-wide. Therefore as we begin the
history of the Early Church it becomes necessary for us to study <b>the
New Testament World</b>.</p>

<p>Comparing the maps before us with that of the Old Testament
World we find that in the four centuries between the events of the
Old and New Testaments the dominion of the world passed from
Asia to Europe, and Jerusalem, which had been in the center,
became one of the cities upon the extreme east. Hence our map
moves with the course of the empire westward a thousand miles.</p>

<p>I. We draw the outlines of the most important <b>Seas</b>. These
are:</p>

<p>1. The <b>Mediterranean Sea</b>, from its eastern limits as far west as
Italy. Voyages on it are referred to in Acts 9. 30; 13. 4; 21. 1, 2;
27. 3.</p>

<p>2. The <b>Sea of Galilee</b>, associated with the life of Christ. Find
its three different names in Matt. 15. 29; John 6. 1; Luke 5. 1.</p>

<p>3. The <b>Dead Sea</b>, not named in the New Testament.</p>

<p>4. The <b>Black Sea</b>, north of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>5. The <b>Ægean Sea</b>, between Asia Minor and Greece. Voyages
upon it (Acts 16. 11; 18. 18; 20. 13-15).</p>

<p>6. The <b>Adriatic Sea</b>, between Greece and Italy (Acts 27. 27).</p>

<p>II. In these seas are many <b>Islands</b>, of which we name five of
the most noteworthy in New Testament history:</p>

<p>1. <b>Cyprus</b>, in the northeast corner of the Mediterranean (Acts
4. 36; 13. 4).</p>

<p>2. <b>Crete</b>, south of the Ægean Sea, between Asia Minor and
Greece (Acts 27. 7; Titus 1. 5).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <b>Patmos</b>, in the Ægean Sea, not far from Ephesus (Rev. 1. 9).</p>

<p>4. <b>Sicily</b>, southwest of Italy (Acts 28. 12).</p>

<p>5. <b>Melita</b>, now Malta, south of Sicily (Acts 28. 1).</p>

<p>III. We locate the different <b>Provinces</b>, arranging them in four
groups.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i071-big.jpg"><img src="images/i071.jpg" width="600" height="386" alt="MAP OF THE NEW TESTAMENT WORLD" /></a>
</div>

<p>1. Those on the continent of <b>Europe</b> are: 1.) <b>Thrace.</b> 2.) <b>Macedonia</b>
(Acts 14. 9, 10; 20. 1-3). 3.) <b>Greece</b>, also called <b>Achaia</b>
(Acts 18. 12; 20. 3). 4.) <b>Illyricum</b> (Rom. 15. 19). 5.) <b>Italy</b>
(Acts 27. 1).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Those on the continent of <b>Africa</b> are: 1.) <b>Africa Proper.</b>
2.) <b>Libya</b> (Acts 2. 10) 3.) <b>Egypt</b> (Matt. 2. 13).</p>

<p>3. Those on the continent of <b>Asia</b>, exclusive of Asia Minor, are:
1.) <b>Arabia</b>, perhaps referring to the desert region southeast of Palestine
(Gal. 1. 17). 2.) <b>Judea</b>, the Jewish name for all Palestine, in
the New Testament period (Luke 1. 5). 3.) <b>Ph&oelig;nicia</b> (Mark 7. 24;
Acts 15. 3; 21. 2). 4.) <b>Syria</b>, north of Palestine (Acts 15. 41;
20. 3).</p>

<p>4. The provinces in <b>Asia Minor</b> are so frequently mentioned in the
Acts and Epistles that it is necessary for the student to learn their
names and locations. We divide the fourteen provinces into four
groups.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><div class='hang1'>(<i>a</i>) Three on the Black Sea, beginning on the east. 1.) <b>Pontus</b>
(Acts 18. 2). 2.) <b>Paphlagonia.</b> 3.) <b>Bithynia</b> (Peter 1. 1).</div>

<div class='hang1'>(<i>b</i>) Three on the Ægean Sea, beginning on the north. 4.)
<b>Mysia</b> (Acts 16. 7). 5.) <b>Lydia.</b> 6.) <b>Caria.</b> These three provinces
together formed the district known as "Asia" (Acts 2.
9; 19. 10).</div>

<div class='hang1'>(<i>c</i>) Three on the Mediterranean Sea, beginning on the west. 7.)
<b>Lycia</b> (Acts 27. 5). 8.) <b>Pamphylia</b> (Acts 13. 13). 9.) <b>Cilicia</b>
(Acts 21. 39).</div>

<div class='hang1'>(<i>d</i>) Five in the interior. 10.) On the north, <b>Galatia</b> (Gal. 1. 2).
11.) On the east, <b>Cappadocia</b> (Acts 2. 9). 12.) On the southeast,
<b>Lycaonia</b> (Acts 14. 6). 13.) On the southwest, <b>Pisidia</b> (Acts
13. 14). 14.) On the west <b>Phrygia</b> (Acts 16. 6).</div></div>

<p>IV. We notice the twelve most important <b>Places</b>.</p>

<p>1. <b>Alexandria</b>, the commercial metropolis of Egypt (Acts 18. 24).</p>

<p>2. <b>Jerusalem</b>, the religious capital of the Jewish world (Matt.
4. 5; Luke 24. 47).</p>

<p>3. <b>Cæsarea</b>, the Roman capital of Judea (Acts 10. 1; 23. 23, 24).</p>

<p>4. <b>Damascus</b>, in the southern part of Syria (Acts 19. 3).</p>

<p>5. <b>Antioch</b>, the capital of Syria, in the north (Acts 11. 26; 13. 1).</p>

<p>6. <b>Tarsus</b>, the birthplace of St. Paul, in Cilicia (Acts 22. 3).</p>

<p>7. <b>Ephesus</b>, the metropolis of Asia Minor, in the province of
Lydia (Acts 19. 1).</p>

<p>8. <b>Philippi</b>, in Macedonia, where the gospel was first preached in
Europe (Acts 16. 12).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>9. <b>Thessalonica</b>, the principal city in Macedonia (Acts 17. 1;
Thess 1. 1).</p>

<p>10. <b>Athens</b>, the literary center of Greece (Acts 17. 16).</p>

<p>11. <b>Corinth</b>, the political capital of Greece (Acts 18. 1-12).</p>

<p>12. <b>Rome</b>, the imperial city (Acts 28. 16; Rom. 1. 7).</p>

<p>Other lands and places are referred to as Elam, Parthia, and Media,
all east of the Euphrates river (Acts 2. 9). Ethiopia, south of Egypt
in Africa (Acts 8. 27), and Babylon on the Euphrates (1 Peter 5. 13);
but these places are outside the general history of the church.</p>


<div class='subtitle'>Hints to the Teacher and Her Class. Eleventh Study</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>In teaching this lesson let the conductor sketch the outline of the map upon
the board and drill upon the seas; then draw and name the islands; then
drill upon the provinces, etc. Review until the lesson is learned by all the
class.</p>

<p>The student should search all the references and be able to state the
events connected with each locality.</p>

<p>It would be well for the student to find additional Scripture references to
all the localities.</p>

<p>Let each student practice the drawing of the map at home, until he can draw
it without copy. Then, in presence of the class, let one student draw on the
blackboard in presence of the class the boundary lines of the continents; or
one the boundary line in Asia; another in Europe; and a third in Africa.
Then let another draw and name the islands; and others locate and name
the provinces in Asia, Europe, and Africa; and finally let the twelve cities
be located and named.</p></div>

<h2>TWELFTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Synagogue</div>


<p>Before beginning the history of the Early Church, we must study
one institution which formed an important link between the Old
Testament and the New; and more than any other institution prepared
the way for the gospel throughout the Jewish world. That
institution was the synagogue.</p>

<p>I. <b>Its Origin.</b> The synagogue arose during the captivity, when
the Temple was in ruins and the sacrifices were in abeyance. In the
land of captivity the people of God met for worship and fellowship,
and out of their meeting grew the synagogue, a word meaning "a
coming together." It is believed that the institution was organized
as a part of the Jewish system by Ezra, B. C. 440.</p>

<p>II. <b>Its Universality.</b> There was but one temple, standing on
Mount Moriah, and only those who journeyed thither could attend
its services. But the synagogue was in every place where the Jews
dwelt, both in Palestine and throughout the world. Wherever
ten Jewish heads of families could be found there a synagogue would
be established. There were four hundred and sixty synagogues in
Jerusalem; and every nationality of Jews had its own (Acts 6. 9).</p>

<p>III. <b>The Place of Meeting.</b> This might be a building erected
for the purpose, or a hired room, or even a place in the open air (Acts
16. 13). This meeting place was employed for secular as well as
religious uses. Courts were held in it, and sentence was administered
(Acts 22. 19), and sometimes a school for teaching the law was
held in it. Thus the synagogue became a center of local influence.</p>

<p>IV. <b>Its Arrangement.</b> Every ancient synagogue contained:</p>

<p>1. <i>An</i> "<i>ark</i>," which was the chest for the sacred rolls, and stood
in the end of the building toward Jerusalem.</p>

<p>2. <i>Chief seats</i>, elevated, near and around the "ark," for the
elders and leading men (Matt. 23. 6).</p>

<p>3. A desk for the reader standing upon a platform.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Places for the worshipers, carefully graded according to
rank, the Gentile visitors having seats near the door of entrance.</p>

<p>5. A lattice gallery where women could worship without being
seen.</p>

<p>V. <b>Its Officers.</b> These were:</p>

<p>1. Three <i>rulers of the synagogue</i>, who directed the worship, managed
the business details, and possessed a limited judicial authority
over the Jews in the district (Mark 4. 22; Acts 13. 15). One of these
was the presiding officer, and called "<i>the</i> ruler."</p>

<p>2. The <i>chazzan</i> (Luke 4. 20, "the minister"), who united the
functions of clerk, schoolmaster, sexton, and constable to administer
sentence on offenders.</p>

<p>3. The <i>batlanim</i>, "men of ease," seven men who were chosen to
act as a legal congregation, were pledged to be present at the regular
services, and sometimes received a small fee for being present.</p>

<p>VI. <b>Its Services.</b> These were held on Saturday, Monday, and
Thursday, and were conducted by the members in turn, several
taking part in each service. They consisted of:</p>

<p>1. Forms of prayer, conducted by a leader, with the responses
by the worshipers.</p>

<p>2. Reading of selections from the law and the prophets, according
to an appointed order (Acts 15. 21). The reading was in
Hebrew, but it was translated, verse by verse, into the language of
the people, whether Greek or Aramaic.</p>

<p>3. Exposition or comment upon the Scripture, in which any
member might take part (Luke 4. 20, 21; Acts 13. 15, 16).</p>

<p>VII. <b>Its Influence.</b> It is easy to perceive how widely and how
powerfully the results of such an institution would reach.</p>

<p>1. It perpetuated the worship of God and united the worshipers.</p>

<p>2. It supplied a more thoughtful and spiritual worship than the
elaborate ritual of the Temple.</p>

<p>3. It promoted the study of the Old Testament Scriptures and
made them thoroughly familiar to every Jew.</p>

<p>4. It attracted the devout and intelligent among the Gentiles,
many of whom became worshipers of God and were known as
"proselytes of the gate" (Acts 10. 1, 2).</p>

<p>VIII. <b>Its Preparation for the Gospel.</b> It is evident that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
apostles and early Christian teachers were greatly aided by the synagogue.</p>

<p>1. It furnished a <i>place</i>; for everywhere the church began in the
synagogue, even though it soon left it (Acts 13. 5; 18. 4; 19. 8).</p>

<p>2. It prepared a <i>people</i>; for the synagogue was attended by the
earnest and thoughtful, both of Jews and Gentiles, who were thus
made ready for the higher truths of the gospel (Acts 13. 42, 43).</p>

<p>3. It supplied a <i>plan of service</i>; for it is evident that the early
Christian worship was modeled, not on the ritual of the Temple, but
on the simpler forms of the synagogue.</p>

<p>4. It gave a <i>system of organization</i>; for the Government of the
early church was similar to, and doubtless <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sugested'">suggested</ins> by, that of the
synagogue.</p>

<h2>THIRTEENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Church in Judea</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Part One</span></div>

<p>From the Ascension of Christ A. D. 30, to the Appointment of
the Seven A. D. 35.</p>

<p>We now enter upon the second great subject in New Testament
history, the Early Church. This will include the annals of the
church from the Ascension of Christ, A. D. 30, to the end of the
apostolic age, A. D. 100. This epoch of seventy years is divided
into four periods:</p>

<p>1. <i>The church in Judea</i>, from the Ascension of Christ, A. D. 30,
to the Appointment of the Seven, A. D. 35.</p>

<p>2. <i>The church in Transition</i>, from the Appointment of the Seven,
A. D. 35, to the Council at Jerusalem, A. D. 50.</p>

<p>3. <i>The church among the Gentiles</i>, from the Council at Jerusalem,
A. D. 50, to the death of St. Paul, A. D. 68.</p>

<p>4. <i>The End of the Age</i>, from the death of St. Paul to the death of
St. John, about A. D. 100. It should be noted that all of these
dates are uncertain and historians are not agreed with reference
to them.</p>

<p>Of these four periods we take up the first, the church in Judea,
or "The church of the First Days;" a space of about five years.
During this time the work of the church was confined wholly to the
Jewish people, and apparently to the immediate region of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>I. We notice the <b>Events of this Period</b>.</p>

<p>1. <b>The followers of Christ</b> immediately after the Ascension; a
company of people believing in Jesus as the Messiah of Israel.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) <i>Their number</i> was 120 (Acts 1. 15). They were mostly
from Galilee (Acts 2. 7). They were all the organized church
at that time, although throughout the land were thousands
more ready to unite with them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>2.) <i>Their meeting place</i> was "the upper room" (Acts 1. 13), on
Mount Zion, probably the room where the "Last
Supper" was held. Some think that this may have been the
house of Mary the mother of Mark, referred to in Acts 12. 1, 2.</p>

<p>3.) <i>Their religious condition</i> between the Ascension and Pentecost
was probably that of belief in Jesus as the King of Israel,
but with the conception of an earthly kingdom (Acts 1. 6).
They were waiting with prayer for divine direction (Acts
1. 14).</p></div>

<p>2. <b>The Outpouring of the Spirit</b> came upon this company on the
day of Pentecost, ten days after the Ascension, fifty days after the
Crucifixion. The spirit descended upon them all in the form of
"tongues of fire."</p>

<p>1.) <i>Physical effect.</i> This was "the gift of tongues," a
mysterious influence (Acts 2. 2, 3). This was not a power to
speak foreign languages at will; but probably a strange
divine speech, sounding to everyone who heard it as though
it were the language of his own people (Acts 2. 8).</p>

<p>2.) <i>Mental effect.</i> There came to these disciples a revelation,
once and for all, of Christ's kingdom, not as a political state,
but as a spiritual institution; a society of believers of which
Jesus in glory is the invisible yet real head.</p>

<p>3.) <i>Spiritual effect.</i> This was the personal presence of the
Holy Spirit with each member; an indwelling life given not
merely to the apostles, but to each and every disciple;
a divine enthusiasm, giving guidance, enlightenment, power.
Nor was that divine life limited to that company. It has
dwelt ever since in the church of Christ, and in each member
of the church, (1 Cor. 3. 16; 6. 19).</p>

<p>3. <b>The Testimony of the Gospel.</b> 1.) The first effect of this new
endowment of the Holy Spirit was a strong testimony to the gospel
of Christ; a proclamation of <i>Jesus as the Messiah King</i>; and this
testimony was the conquering weapon of the church. 2.) This testimony
was given by <i>all</i> the members. It is a mistake to suppose that
the church settled down in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jersualem'">Jerusalem</ins> with Peter as its pastor and
preacher. Peter was the leader, but not the ruler of the church.
Find four addresses of Peter sketched in Acts 2-5; not "sermons"
after the modern method, but ardent declarations of Jesus as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Messiah; and similar testimonies were given by all the members
everywhere, in synagogues, in houses, publicly and privately.</p>

<p>4. <b>The Apostolic Miracles.</b> 1.) At the opening of the history of
the church we read of a <i>number of miracles</i>. a) A lame man healed.
(Acts 3. 1-10). b) A miracle of judgment (Acts 5. 1-10). c) More
miracles of healing (Acts 5. 12-16). 2.) We can see the <i>purpose
of these</i> miracles and how they were needed by the church in the day
of its weakness. (a) They attracted <i>attention</i> to the gospel. (b)
They gave <i>authority</i> to the apostles as teachers. (c) They were
<i>illustrations</i> of the spiritual work of the gospel; i. e., healing of the
lame man a type of salvation.</p>

<p>5. <b>The Persecution of the Apostles.</b> It was inevitable that the
preaching of the apostles and the growing prominence of the church
should arouse opposition from the men who a few months before had
crucified Jesus. A persecution was begun, at first upon Peter and
John, then upon all the apostles. It was not sharp, murderous,
crushing out the church. The apostles were first threatened (Acts
4. 17), then imprisoned (Acts 5. 18), then scourged (Acts 5. 40).
The persecution only attracted greater notice to the gospel, and led
to increasing numbers of believers.</p>

<p>6. <b>The Growth of the Church</b> went on through all these experiences.
Beginning with 120, on the day of Pentecost 3,000 were
received by baptism (Acts 2. 41). There was a daily growth after
(Acts 2. 47). Soon the number grew to 5,000, besides women and
children (Acts 4. 4). Another increase is named in Acts 5. 14; also
again in Acts 6. 7.</p>

<p>7. The last event in this period was <b>the Appointment of the
Seven</b>. Read the account in Acts 6. 1-7. Notice for the first time
in this history a reference to the two great classes of Jews. 1.)
<i>Hebrews</i>, Jews whose ancestors had lived in Palestine, and who spoke
the Hebrew tongue, though with Syriac admixture. 2.) <i>Grecian
Jews</i> (frequently called Hellenists). Jews descended from exiles who
had remained abroad in foreign lands, otherwise "Jews of the Dispersion."
Everywhere except in Palestine these foreign Jews were
far more numerous than the Hebrews, and they were also the richer
and more intelligent. They spoke the Greek language.</p>

<p>Note also that the seven men named in this account are nowhere
spoken of as "deacons." From Acts 21. 8 we learn that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
called "the seven." They were not an order in the church, but a
committee appointed for a service.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Part Two</span></div>

<p>II. Having studied the history we now look at the <b>General
Aspects of the Pentecostal Church</b>.</p>

<p>1. <b>Its locality</b>: entirely in Judea, and apparently in and around
Jerusalem. There is no mention during this early period of churches
in Galilee, although most of the earliest members were Galileans
(Acts 1. 11; 2. 7). Individual believers doubtless were to be
found throughout the land, but outside of Jerusalem they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
not yet gathered together in assemblies and not yet endowed
with the Spirit.</p>

<p>2. <b>Its membership</b> was composed wholly of Jews. As yet not
a single Gentile had been received, and apparently there was no
thought of Gentile believers. Christianity began as a Jewish society.
Three classes of Jews were embraced in its membership: 1.) <i>Hebrews</i>,
or Palestinian Jews. 2.) <i>Grecians</i> or Hellenists, Jews of the Dispersion.
3.) <i>Proselytes</i>, or Gentiles who had embraced Judaism
and received circumcision (Acts 6. 5).</p>

<p>3. <b>The qualifications for membership</b> were: 1.) <i>Repentance</i>,
which meant not so much sorrow as decision for Christ. 2.) <i>Faith in
Jesus</i> as Christ; i. e., submission to Jesus as the true King of Israel.
3.) <i>Baptism</i> in the name of Jesus the Christ as the outward form of
consecration.</p>

<p>4. <b>The spirit of the Pentecostal Church.</b> 1.) In theory, and for
the most part in fact, every member <i>possessed the Holy Spirit</i>, an
abounding, directing spiritual life. Every member was conscious
of the immediate presence of God, and lived in this fellowship. 2.)
This inspired a <i>Christian fellowship</i>, the love of the brotherhood.
3.) As a result of this divine and human fellowship came <i>liberal
giving</i> to each other's needs. There was a voluntary and limited
"community of goods," the rich giving freely to aid the poor;
which led to some insincere imitation. See the contrast of Barnabas
and Ananias (Acts 4. 34-37; 5. 1-11).</p>

<p>5. <b>Doctrines.</b> The doctrinal aspects of Christianity at that
early period were less prominent than its spirit. As yet there was
no such theological system as arose later. Three great doctrines
were held fervently: 1.) <i>The resurrection of Jesus</i>; that he had
risen and was living. 2.) <i>The Messiahship of Jesus</i>; that he was the
prince of the true spiritual kingdom of Israel. 3.) <i>The return of
Jesus as Christ</i>; that he would soon come again to earth.</p>

<p>6. <b>Worship and institutions.</b> These were: 1.) <i>The temple
worship</i> attended by the disciples of Christ as by all worshiping
Jews (Acts 2. 46; 3. 1). 2.) <i>The synagogue services</i>, twice each
week; held everywhere throughout the city; with Scripture reading,
prayer and testimony. 3.) "<i>The upper room</i>" was for a time
the headquarters of the church; but Solomon's porch in the temple
soon took its place (Acts 5. 12). 4.) "Breaking bread," which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper; at that time observed not
in public assemblies but as a family ordinance, at home (Acts 2.
42, 46). 5.) <i>The baptism</i> of new members.</p>

<p>7. <b>Government.</b> Scarcely any government or discipline was
needed in a church where the Spirit of God was recognized as dwelling
in each member. The apostles were revered as leaders, but
were not exactly rulers over the body of believers. "The Seven"
(Acts 6. 3) were not officials or "deacons," but laymen charged
with specific duties.</p>

<p>8. <b>Literature.</b> 1.) <i>The Old Testament</i>; familiar to all, read in
the synagogue, was seen now in a new light and with new meaning.
2.) <i>The teachings of Jesus</i>, as yet unwritten, were in the memory of
most of the members who had heard his words; and especially in the
memory of the apostles; but no books of the New Testament were
by this time in writing.</p>

<p>9. <b>Leaders of the church.</b> 1.) Throughout this period <i>Peter</i>
stands at the front as the ruling spirit of the church, by his endowments
of mind, and especially by his promptness in word and act.
2.) With him stands <i>John</i> (Acts 3. 1; 4. 19). 3.) <i>Barnabas</i> won
notice by his liberality and gifts of preaching (Acts 4. 36, 37). His
name means "the speaker" or "the preacher." 4.) At the end
of the period <i>Stephen</i> comes into notice.</p>

<h2>FOURTEENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Church in Transition</div>

<h3>From the Appointment of the Seven, A. D. 35, to the Council
at Jerusalem, A. D. 50.</h3>


<p>We enter upon the study of a brief period, only fifteen years, but
of supreme importance and of vast results to the world; a period, too,
in which we have the deepest interest, for if its events had never
taken place Christianity would have been only a Jewish sect and
we would not be members of it.</p>

<p>1. At its opening, 35 A. D., the church was in and around Jerusalem
only; and every member was a Jew, bound by the restrictions
of the Jewish law and ceremony. There was no thought that the
church would ever include Gentiles except as Gentiles might first
become proselytes to Judaism.</p>

<p>2. At its close, 50 A. D., we see a church planted all around
the northeastern portion of the Mediterranean Sea; and, what is
even more remarkable, a church wherein Jews and Gentiles were
worshiping together on terms of equality. A wonderful transition
this!</p>

<p>I. Let us draw <b>the Map of the Lands</b> occupied by the church
during those fifteen years. 1. Draw the coast line of the Mediterranean
Sea. 2. The island of Cyprus. 3. The lands east of the
Mediterranean Sea. Judea (or Palestine), Syria, Ph&oelig;nicia. 4.
The lands north of the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor, Cilicia,
Pamphylia, Pisidia, Lycaonia. 5. The places: Jerusalem, Joppa,
Cæsarea and Samaria in Judea, Damascus and Antioch in Syria,
Tarsus in Cilicia, Antioch in Pisidia, Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia.</p>

<p>II. Let us carefully note the <b>Progress of Events</b> in this remarkable
evolution of the church.</p>

<p>1. <b>The Preaching of Stephen.</b> Stephen was a Hellenist, or a
Jew of foreign origin. He was the man who first had the vision of
a church wider than the bounds of Judaism; and he proclaimed this
great truth. See evidences of this in:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) The new and bitter <i>enmity</i> which his teaching aroused
(Acts 6. 12).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>2.) The <i>accusation</i> against him, which contained a half truth
(Acts 6. 11, 13, 14).</p>

<p>3.) The <i>prominence</i> of the man, and his discourse, the longest
public discourse reported in the New Testament, except the
Sermon on the Mount (Acts 7. 1-53).</p>

<p>4.) The <i>logical aim</i> of his address: to show that the Jews had
shown themselves unworthy of their trust, implying that it
would be given to others. This sermon was never finished,
being broken up by the riotous acts of the council.</p></div>

<p>2. <b>Saul's Persecution</b> (Acts 8. 1-3). We shall study this man's
early history later. (See <a href="#Page_96">page 96</a>). He was intense and furious
in his loyalty to Judaism, and undertook to crush out the gospel of
Christ by violent measures. See Acts 22. 4; 26. 10, 11; Gal. 1. 13.
1.) As a result the Pentecostal church was broken up and its members
were scattered. 2.) But, as another effect, these disciples who
were scattered went everywhere preaching (Acts 8. 4). These
"preachers" were not the apostles; they were lay-members; not
delivering sermons, but testifying in country synagogues and in
homes the gospel of Christ. 3.) Another result followed, churches
sprang up throughout Judea (Acts 9. 31), Samaria (Acts 8. 14), and
Syria (Acts 9. 2, 10; Acts 11. 19). Thus Saul by his persecution
unconsciously aided the spread of the gospel.</p>

<p>3. <b>The Gospel in Samaria</b> (Acts 8. 5-8). One of these disciples,
Philip (not the apostle, but one of the "seven" Acts 6. 5),
went to Samaria, and there preached with great success. A significant
event, showing breadth of view and victory over prejudice.
See John 4. 9. The Samaritans were regarded, not exactly as Gentiles,
but as irregular and inferior, and despised even more than
Gentiles. Still more significant, the Samaritan church was recognized
by the apostles and received the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts
8. 14-17). Note also that, after his work in Samaria, Philip went
down to the coast and established a chain of churches from Azotus
to Cæsarea (Acts 8. 40).</p>

<p>4. <b>Peter's Vision</b> (Acts 10. 1-48), and the events accompanying
it, was the next step in the forward movement of the church. The
leading apostle and most prominent man in the church, under direction
of the Spirit, journeys thirty miles to preach to a little company
of Gentiles; the Spirit falls upon them, another Pentecost; and Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
baptizes them. Here, then, is a genuine church of Gentiles founded
by an apostle; the first fruits of a great harvest.</p>

<p>5. The next step is even more momentous in its results, <b>the
Conversion of Saul</b> (Acts 9. 1-19). It seems to be a sudden conversion,
but one expression (Acts 9. 5) shows that Saul had been struggling
against conviction. His enmity had not been so greatly
against "Jesus as Christ" as against "Christ for all the world" i. e.,
the gospel as preached by Stephen; and when converted he went
fully over to Stephen's view, and became Stephen's successor, with
even larger vision. Note the order of events in Saul's early ministry.
1.) Preaching in Damascus (Acts 9. 20-22). 2.) Retirement to
Arabia (Gal. 1. 17). This may mean almost anywhere to the east or
south of Palestine. In our opinion, he went thither not to
meditate nor to study theology, but to preach in the cities between
Palestine and the desert. 3.) Again preaching in Damascus (Gal. 1.
17). His escape (Acts 9. 23-25). 4.) Visit to Jerusalem (Acts 9.
26-28). Whom he met on this visit (Gal. 1. 8, 19). The event
which led to his departure from Jerusalem (Acts 22. 17-21). 5.)
His return to his birthplace (Acts 9. 29, 30. Gal. 1. 21). Let the
student draw on the map all the journeys of Saul, beginning with
his journey from Jerusalem to Damascus before his conversion.</p>

<p>VI. <b>The Church at Antioch.</b> (Acts 11. 19-30). Antioch was the
third city of the Roman empire; capital of Syria, of which Judea
was a dependency. Its many Jews had their synagogues, each with
its "court of the Gentiles," where the Gentile worshipers sat during
the services. In the story of this church note 1.) Its unnamed
founders (Acts 11. 19). 2.) Its membership of both Jews and
Gentiles (Acts 11. 20). See American Revised Version. 3.) Its
prominence (Acts 11. 22-26). 4.) Its liberality (Acts 11. 27-30).
5.) Some of its workers (Acts 13. 1). 6.) Note how Saul came to
be associated with this church (Acts 11. 25, 26).</p>

<p>VII. <b>The First Missionary Journey</b> (Acts 13. 1-4). Another
step in advance was taken when two missionaries went out to plant
churches of both Jews and Gentiles. 1.) They were called by the
Holy Spirit (ver. 2). 2.) Approved by the church (Ver. 3). 3.)
Their method; whenever possible beginning with the synagogue,
where they would have access both to devout Jews and devout Gentiles
(Acts 13. 5). 4.) The lands visited. Cyprus (Acts 13. 4-6).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Pisidia (Acts 13. 14). Lycaonia (Acts 14. 6). On the return journey,
Pamphylia (Acts 14. 24, 25). Let the student draw the maps
showing the lands and places, and the route of the journey. One
province in the southern tier was left unvisited, Cilicia, because Paul
had already preached there (Gal. 1. 21-23).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 335px;">
<a href="images/i088-big.jpg"><img src="images/i088.jpg" width="335" height="400" alt="map of countries the apostles visited" /></a>
</div>

<p>VIII. <b>The Council at Jerusalem</b> (Acts 15). Of course such a
spread of the gospel among the Gentiles would be very unwelcome
to narrow Jewish believers. Their complaint and demand (Acts
15. 1, 2). Who attended the Council at Jerusalem (Acts 15. 2-4).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Who took prominent part in it (Acts 15. 7, 13). The conclusion of
the Council (Acts 15. 27-29).</p>

<p>The great question was now settled. Jews and Gentiles were
standing at last on equality in the church, and the great transition
from a Jewish church to a church for all the world was accomplished.</p>


<div class='subtitle'>Hints to the Teacher and the Student</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1. Read carefully in the book of Acts from the 8th to the 15th chapter,
inclusive.</p>

<p>2. Draw the map first from copy, then without copy; not seeking for
accuracy, but aiming rather for correct relation of the lands to each other.</p>

<p>3. Study each section of the lesson; look up every reference, and note its
relation to the general subject. Master the eight points in the outline thoroughly.</p>

<p>4. Draw on the map (or, better, on a series of maps) the following journeys:
1.) Philip's journeys. Acts 8. 2.) Peter's journeys. Acts 8 and 10. 3.)
Saul's early journeys. 4.) The journey of Saul and Barnabas. 5.) The
journeys in connection with the council at Jerusalem, going and returning.</p>

<p>5. Let the teacher call upon the scholars to tell as a story each of the eight
points in the lesson, not from the text-book but from the book of Acts; each
story by a student in turn.</p></div>

<h2>FIFTEENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Church Twenty Years After the Ascension</div>


<p>We have now studied the two earliest periods in the history of the
Christian church and have come to the year 50 A. D., twenty years
after the Ascension of Christ and the outpouring of the Spirit on
the first Pentecost. Let us look over the field and see what at that
time was the state of the church.</p>

<p>I. <b>Its Extent.</b> Let the student draw again the map given
with the last lesson, and locate upon it the following <b>lands</b>: 1.
Judea (Palestine). 2. Syria. 3. Ph&oelig;nicia. 4. Cyprus. 5.
Cilicia. 6. Pamphylia. 7. Pisidia. 8. Lycaonia. In all these
lands churches were established and at work.</p>

<p>II. <b>Its Membership.</b> The members of the church consisted of
two classes of people, widely apart by nature, but brought together
by the gospel:</p>

<p>1. There were churches where all the members were <b>Jews</b>, as
in Judea. These were all faithful to the regulations of the Jewish
ceremonial law, and many of them almost bigoted in their opinions
concerning it (Acts 15. 1, 5).</p>

<p>2. There were other churches, as in Lycaonia, where all or
nearly all the members were <b>Gentiles</b> (Acts 14. 6-13). In these the
Jewish rules were unrecognized, almost unknown.</p>

<p>3. Between these two extremes was the great body of churches
of <b>both Jews and Gentiles</b>. The two classes worshiped together;
Jews remaining Jews, and Gentiles remaining Gentiles; but probably
received the Lord's Supper apart, as it was as yet a house-service,
not held at the public meetings.</p>

<p>4. While in most churches there was harmony, on both sides
there were some radical members; but especially among the Jews.
These were the <b>Judaizers</b>; men who sought to compel all the disciples
to receive circumcision, obey the ceremonial law and make the
Christian church subordinate to Jewish ritualism. These were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
enemies of Paul to the end of his ministry, perverting the Gentile
churches and opposing the apostle's work.</p>

<p>III. <b>Its Leaders.</b> Three names stand out prominently at this
time: 1. <b>Paul</b>, as the leader of the church in its world-wide plans,
the apostle to the Gentiles (Gal. 2. 7). 2. <b>James</b>, as leader of the
Jewish but not Judaizing elements (Acts 13. 13, 19). This was not
James the apostle, for he had been put to death some time before
this (Acts 12. 2); but James "the brother of the Lord" (Gal. 1.
19). He was the head of the church in Jerusalem and author of the
Epistle of James. 3. <b>Peter</b>, who stood in friendly relation to both
parties in the church, although his conduct was not always perfectly
consistent with regard to Jewish regulations (Acts 11. 2, 3; Gal. 2.
11-14). Between these three leaders there was a clear understanding
and no strong division of spirit, although they might not agree
in all points. 4. Other leaders in this period were <b>Philip</b> (Acts 8.
40; 21. 8). <b>Barnabas</b>, <b>Silas</b> of Jerusalem and Antioch (Acts 15. 22,
32, 40), and <b>Titus</b> (Gal. 2. 1-4).</p>

<p>IV. <b>Its Government.</b> In our time the church is often a highly
wrought organization, with articles of faith, orders, and officials of
various grades. We are apt to assume such a condition in the early
church. But at the time of which we speak there was very little
organization or machinery; and there was little need of any, for a
special reason: <i>Every member was under the direct guidance of the
Holy Spirit</i>, living in fellowship with God, without mediation of
priest or church. Yet we find certain officers named in the church:</p>

<p>1. <b>Apostles</b>, originally "the twelve," but changes arose and
others were called by the title, for example, Paul and Barnabas
(Acts 14. 14); James (Gal. 1. 19). The work of the apostles was
not primarily government, but inspired testimony to Jesus as the
Christ (Acts 1. 22; 6. 4); nowhere in Acts are the apostles represented
as ruling the church (Acts 15. 6, 22).</p>

<p>2. <b>Elders</b> (Acts 11. 30; 14. 23; 15. 4). These were analogous
to the same officers in the synagogue, from which the plan of the
local churches was taken.</p>

<p>3. <b>Prophets</b> (Acts 11. 27, 28; Acts 13. 1; Acts 15. 32). Men
who spoke out of direct fellowship with the Lord, and under
inspiration of the Spirit; sometimes, though not always, giving
predictions of future events.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>Teachers</b> (Acts 13. 1). Men who gave instruction in the Christian
character; probably largely from recollection or knowledge of
the teaching of Christ. The difference between "prophesy" and
"teaching" was that the former was the more spontaneous and the
latter the more educative in the principles of the gospel.</p>

<p>V. <b>Its Doctrinal Views.</b> These remained substantially as in the
first period. There was little tendency toward intellectual questionings
while the church remained under Jewish influence. The
discussion was rather regarding Jewish ceremonial regulations.
The Messiahship, Resurrection and Return of Jesus were still the
prominent teaching of the period.</p>

<p>VI. <b>Its Moral Standards.</b> The church is now face to face with
the heathen world and all its abominable vices. Heathen moralists
continually made excuse for the immorality which was so generally
practiced. But Christianity made no compromise; set forth the
high standard of the gospel, with the character of Christ as its ideal.
This high standard unswervingly maintained was one secret of the
church's power and growth. Notice, a little later than this period,
in St. Paul's writings, the strong ethical spirit.</p>

<p>VII. <b>Its Meeting-places.</b> As yet "churches" or buildings for
worship were not erected. The disciples met with the Jews in the
synagogue or established synagogues of their own (James 2. 2).
Often they met, even later than this period, in the upper rooms of
private houses (Acts 20. 8; Rom. 16. 3-5; Philem. 2).</p>

<p>VIII. <b>Its Literature.</b> This was still the <b>Old Testament</b> only; no
book of the New Testament having been written as early as 50 A. D.
These writings were familiar to all the Jewish members, and almost
equally familiar to the Gentiles who attended the synagogue.
Was there an "oral gospel" in existence? Probably not in any set,
authorized form; but repeated as the narration of teachings and
works of Jesus. The tendency would naturally be for these teachings
to settle into a few accepted forms or "gospels."</p>

<p>IX. Wherein did <b>the Unity of the Church</b> consist? Not in organization,
nor government, nor doctrinal statement; but in a <b>common
spiritual life</b>. They were of one heart and one mind, loved
each other, contributed to each other's needs (Acts 11. 29; Gal.
2. 10), visited each other's churches (Acts 11. 22, 27, 30; 13. 25;
15. 27, 32). This was, and is, true church unity.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h2>SIXTEENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Preparation of Paul for his Work</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Part One</span></div>

<p>Before we enter upon the study of "The church among the Gentiles,"
our next period, there is a preliminary topic to be considered.
The only record which we possess of the period before us, the
Book of Acts, not only represents Paul as the leading worker for
the gospel, but it even omits all reports of the work of other apostles
and evangelists. There must have been other workers: Peter, Barnabas,
Philip, and other workers were still living, and must have been
active in founding churches; but their work is not mentioned. We
find mention of churches which Paul had not founded (Acts 21. 3, 7;
Acts 28. 13, 14, 15). Paul stands before us as the leading and the
typical worker in the gospel. We will therefore take for our theme,
<b>The Preparation and Methods of Paul</b>.</p>

<p>At A. D. 50 Paul is now at Antioch, about fifty years old, having
been born probably about four years after Jesus Christ. His first
missionary journey has taken place, and he is now about to enter
upon his second missionary journey. Let us notice some of his
advantages for leadership in the gospel.</p>

<p>I. He was <b>a Jew</b>. (See Phil. 3. 5; Rom. 11. 1). The leader in
this movement must be a Jew. 1. Because as a Jew he would have
a <i>training</i> in Bible knowledge, and in the <i>faith</i> of a coming Messiah
such as no Gentile could possess. 2. Moreover the work in nearly
all places must begin in the synagogue. (See Acts 17. 1; 2. 10;
18. 1, 4; 19. 1, 8). And only a Jew could take part in its services.</p>

<p>II. He was a <b>Trained and Recognized Rabbi</b>: an accredited
teacher of the law; "a college man" with the prestige of scholarship
won in the school of Gamaliel, the greatest Jewish master of
that age (Acts 5. 34; Acts 22. 3). Such a teacher would be welcome
in any synagogue. In this respect contrast Paul with Peter
and the other apostles (Acts 4. 13).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>III. He was a <b>Hellenist</b>, or "Grecian Jew;" i. e., a Jew of the
Dispersion; by birth and environment broader than the Jews of
Jerusalem, who rarely came in contact with Gentiles. He was a
traveler acquainted with the world; spoke Greek as fluently as
Hebrew, an absolute necessity for preaching to Gentiles (Acts 21.
37, 40). He spoke to the Greek philosophers in their own tongue
and after their own manner. Contrast Acts 17. 22 with Acts 22. 1.
Tradition says that Peter, when at Rome, used an interpreter in
preaching to the church. Paul's ability to speak at least two
languages gave him a great advantage.</p>

<p>IV. Another advantage was that he was by birth a <b>Roman Citizen</b>
(Acts 16. 37. Acts 22. 25-28). This privilege, at that time
rare among those outside of Italy, gave the apostle safety, immunity
from imprisonment by the local rulers, and the right to a trial before
a Roman judge, with appeal to the emperor. James was put to
death, and Peter thrown into prison by King Herod (Acts 12. 2-4);
but Paul was by his citizenship undoubtedly saved more than once
from torture and from death.</p>

<p>V. He was a divinely-called <b>Apostle</b>. When he spoke it was
with all the fervor and authority of one who had seen the Lord and
had received a special command from the lips of the ascended Christ
to bear testimony to his gospel. His call came with his conversion
(Acts 26. 12-19). He claimed the authority of an apostle
(Gal. 1. 1; 1 Cor. 9. 1). Notice that in his letters Paul always
places "apostles" before "prophets" (Eph. 2. 20; 3. 5; 4. 11), as
holding the higher office in the church.</p>

<p>VI. He possessed rare <b>Natural Endowments</b> for his work.</p>

<p>1. He was a man of <i>sympathy</i>, warm-hearted and tender; making
strong friendships, drawing men after him. Note how in every
place he found friends (Acts 19. 31; 20. 4; 27. 3, 43).</p>

<p>2. He was a <i>preacher</i> of power. He was a master of the art of
public speaking; and people would always listen to him with the
deepest interest (Acts 17. 22-31. Acts 22. 1-2. Acts 26. 1-26).</p>

<p>3. He was a <i>theologian</i>. He saw the great truths of the gospel
in clearer light than any of his co-workers. Under the guidance
of the Spirit he formulated a system of doctrine (Gal. 1. 11, 12),
which he sometimes called "my gospel" (Rom. 2. 16; 2 Tim. 2. 8).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
This "gospel according to Paul," presented in his great epistles,
came to be the theology of the church, and so remains.</p>

<p>4. He possessed rare <i>tact</i> in dealing with men; knew how to
adapt his methods to people of varied races and views. His manner
of preaching at Athens was very different from that in Jerusalem.
Note 1 Cor. 9. 19-22.</p>

<p>5. He was a <i>natural leader</i> of men; ready to take responsibilities,
quick to decide, yet thoughtful of others. He possessed the ruling
spirit, yet was no imperious, self-willed man. People were as ready
to follow as he was to lead.</p>

<p>6. He was a <i>tireless worker</i>; indomitable and undiscouraged,
caring little for hardship (2 Cor. 11. 23-28), although he seems to
have been delicate in health. See allusions 2 Cor. 12. 7-10. Gal.
4. 13. Notice the field of his labors, in the middle of his ministry
(Rom. 15. 19). Notice too his plans for regions more distant (Rom.
15. 24).</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Part Two</span></div>

<p>VII. We must also study Paul's <b>Methods of Work</b>. These were
varied greatly according to circumstances, but in them we may note
certain principles.</p>

<p>1. <i>He took fellow workers</i> with him. Notice his companions on
his first journey. Acts 13. 2-5. On his second journey. Acts 15.
40; 16. 1-3. What other companion is indicated in the word "we"
in Acts 16. 10? On his third journey. Acts 19. 22, 29. Other companions
on this journey. Acts 20. 4, 5. This method gave 1.)
<i>Mutual encouragement</i>. Paul was social, loved companionship; was
sometimes melancholy when alone (Acts 17. 15, 16; 2 Cor. 2. 12, 13;
2 Cor. 7. 5, 6). 2.) <i>Power in co-operation</i>; two can do much more
than twice as much as one. 3.) There was also <i>training</i> for younger
workers, whom Paul always took with him; e. g., Mark, Timothy,
and perhaps Titus.</p>

<p>2. <i>He chose the cities</i>; and of these the largest and most important
centers of population. Antioch, Thessalonica, Corinth, Ephesus,
Rome. Paul was, in training and tastes, a man of the city, not
of the country. He took great interest in men, but apparently none
in nature. Contrast Paul in this respect with Christ, most of whose
illustrations were drawn from nature. One result of Paul's choice
of the cities was the wide and rapid diffusion of the gospel. The
cities became Christian long before the country-places. The word
"pagan" literally means "countryman," but it came to mean a
worshiper of idols. See the effect of Paul's two years in Ephesus
(Acts 19. 10). "The seven churches of Asia" (Rev. 1. 11) were the
outgrowth of Paul's work in Ephesus.</p>

<p>3. <i>He supported himself by his trade.</i> His occupation. Acts 18. 3.
References to his self-support in different places. 1 Cor. 4. 12;
1 Thess. 2. 9; Acts 20. 34; Paul's was a "self-supporting mission,"
because there was no society to support him and he would not lay
the burden upon those just converted. But although he asked no
contributions, he accepted them when tendered. Phil. 4. 15; 16. 18.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>He began in the synagogue.</i> In every large city there were
Jewish synagogues; and in these Paul could speak as an accepted
Rabbi. Note how constantly he made use of the synagogue. Acts
13. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '5, 4'">4, 5</ins>. Acts 14. 1. Acts 17. 1. Acts 18. 4, 19. This method
gave him access to the worshiping Scripture-loving <i>Jews</i>, to whom
he felt called to give the gospel first (Rom. 1. 16). But it also gave
him access to the thoughtful, serious <i>Gentiles</i> who were seeking
after God; and from this class came many of the early Christians.
Notice that in Paul's opening address in Antioch in Pisidia he
addressed both these classes (Acts 13. 16). The synagogue among
the Jews of the dispersion was a great aid to the gospel.</p>

<p>5. He formed <i>acquaintance with rulers</i> and influential men in
many places; in so many that it cannot have been accidental, but
must have been a part of his plan. Examine the following references,
and note names and places: Acts 13. 7. Acts 17. 34. Rom.
16. 23. Acts 19. 31. Acts 28. 7. These friendships were often
of great service to Paul, especially when opposed by his own people.</p>

<p>6. <i>He used the pen</i> as well as the voice. He wrote many letters,
not so much to spread the gospel as to strengthen and instruct the
churches which he had planted. A number of his letters to churches
and to individuals have been preserved; but it is evident that some
have been lost (1 Cor. 5. 9. Col. 4. 16).</p>

<p>7. He strengthened his work by frequently <i>revisiting his churches</i>.
Notice a re-visitation on his first journey (Acts 14. 21). The same
churches visited again on his second journey (Acts 16. 1-4). Again
on his third journey he passed through the same places (Acts 19. 1).
A re-visitation of the European churches (Acts 20. 1, 2).</p>

<p>VIII. Note, lastly, <b>Paul's Enemies</b>; those who throughout his
journeys opposed, fought, persecuted him. Almost everywhere his
work stirred up violent antagonisms. This came in different places
from three sources:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Jews</i>, whose opposition came not so much from his
preaching Jesus as the Messiah as from his willingness to receive
Gentiles into the church. He was regarded as breaking down the
distinctions between Jew and Gentile. Note instances of persecution
from this source (Acts 13. 45, 50. Acts 14. 1, 2. Acts 14. 19.
Acts 17. 5. Acts 21. 27).</p>

<p>2. <i>The Judaizing Christians</i>; professed disciples who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
opposed to Gentile membership in the church (Acts 15. 1, 5. Acts
21. 20, 21. Phil. 1. 14-17). As the years passed the proportion
of Jews to Gentiles in the church became less and less, and this party
diminished in power.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Gentiles.</i> In only two places do we find persecution
stirred up against Paul by Gentiles without suggestion by Jews.
Note the places and circumstances in Acts 16. 16-24. Acts 19
23-30. In each instance private interests caused the trouble. As
yet there was no strife between Christianity and the imperial government.
But Paul saw the trials impending, and not far distant,
and he forewarned his churches of sharper persecution soon to come
(Thess. 2. 3-10. Acts 20. 29. Phil. 1. 28-30).</p>

<h2>SEVENTEENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Church among the Gentiles</div>

<h3>From the Council at Jerusalem, A. D. 50, To the Death of St. Paul,
A. D. 68.</h3>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Part One</span></div>

<p>The history of this period of eighteen years, as contained in the
book of Acts, is limited to the labors of St. Paul, who was pre-eminently
the apostle to the Gentiles (2 Tim. 1. 11).</p>

<p>I. Let us draw the <b>map of the lands</b> embraced in the later journeys
of the apostle Paul.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Lands</i>:&nbsp; 1.) Asia Minor.&nbsp; 2.) Thrace.&nbsp; 3.) Macedonia.
4.) Greece or Achaia.&nbsp; 5.) Italy.&nbsp; 6.) Africa, not visited by Paul.
7.) Palestine or Judea.&nbsp; 8.) Syria.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Localities.</i>&nbsp; 1.) Jerusalem.&nbsp; 2.) Antioch.&nbsp; 3.) Ephesus.
4.) Troas. 5.)&nbsp; Philippi.&nbsp; 6.) Thessalonica.&nbsp; 7.) Berea.&nbsp; 8.)
Athens.&nbsp; 9.) Corinth.&nbsp; 10.) Rome.</p>

<p>II. <b>Paul's Second Missionary Journey.</b> The gospel in Europe
(A. D. 51-53). Notice:</p>

<p>1. <i>His companions</i>: the quarrel with Barnabas and separation
(Acts 15. 36-39). Barnabas at this point drops out of the record.
Silas, Timothy, and later Luke, accompany Paul (Acts 15. 40; 16. 1;
16. 10). Luke's profession, perhaps therein helping the apostle
(Col. 4. 14).</p>

<p>2. <i>Asia Minor revisited.</i> Note and locate the provinces
through which they passed, starting from Antioch: 1.) Cilicia
(Acts 15. 41). 2.) Lycaonia (Acts 16. 1, 3.) Probably Pisidia
(Acts 16. 4). 4.) Galatia. 5.) Phrygia (Acts 16. 6). Through
Mysia to Troas (Acts 16. 8). Locate these provinces on the map.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Gospel in Europe.</i> Note the events which led to the voyage
across the Ægean Sea (Acts 16. 9). Trace the route on the

(Acts 16. 12; 17. 1; 17. 10). The two cities in Greece (Acts 17.

city in Greece and the commercial metropolis, at that time far
more important than Athens.</p>

<p>Review and locate the five cities in Europe thus far visited, P. T.
B. A. C., and recall the peculiar events at each place.</p>

<p>4. <i>The two Epistles to the Thessalonians</i> were written while Paul
was at Corinth, perhaps 52 and 53 A. D. These are the earliest
extant writings of Paul, and the earliest books of the New Testament.
Two subjects are presented in both letters: 1.) General precepts
concerning <i>Christian character</i>. 2.) The <i>second coming of
Christ</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>A visit to Ephesus</i>, the chief city of Asia Minor (Acts 18. 18,
19). Notice what would be the direct route from Corinth. Paul's
stay at this time was short, but with promise of a speedy return.</p>

<p>6. <i>Return to Antioch.</i> The route, from Ephesus to Cæsarea,
thence to the mother church at Jerusalem; thence 250 miles either
by land via Damascus, or by water via Cæsarea (Acts 18. 22). The
great result of the second missionary journey was the planting of
the gospel in Europe. The churches founded were composed of
both Jews and Gentiles, with the latter largely in the majority.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Part Two</span></div>

<p>II. <b>Paul's Third Missionary Journey</b> (A. D. 54-58). His
companions are named in Acts 19. 22. The latter seems to have
been a man of importance from Corinth (Rom. 16. 23). We trace
the journey, starting, as both the former journeys, from Antioch:</p>

<p>1. <i>From Antioch to Ephesus</i> (Acts 18. 23). He went through
Galatia and Phrygia, visiting churches already founded. Some
think that this indicates a fourth visit to Lycaonia and Pisidia, as
those lands were loosely regarded as belonging to Galatia; but this
is not certain.</p>

<p>2. <i>Three years in Ephesus.</i> (Acts 19. 1-20.) In this metropolis
of Asia Minor Paul made a stay longer than in any other place during
his ministry. As results, churches arose in all that region:
Colossæ (Col. 2. 2; 2. 1), Hierapolis (Col. 4. 13), and "the seven
churches of Asia" (Rev. 1. 11).</p>

<p>3. <i>Macedonia and Greece revisited.</i> We can tell what places he
would visit in this journey through former fields, although they are
not named&mdash;the four or five cities wherein he had already planted
churches: Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea (Athens?), Corinth. One
of his errands on this journey, not mentioned in Acts, is frequently
referred to in the epistles of this period, his <i>collection for the poor
Christians in Judea</i>. See Rom. 15. 26, 27. 1 Cor. 16. 1-3. 2 Cor.
9. 1-4. Probably the care of these funds was one reason for the
large number of disciples accompanying Paul on his return journey
(Acts 20. 4).</p>

<p>4. <i>Epistles of this Period.</i> These were the following:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) <i>First Corinthians</i>, written from Ephesus, perhaps about
57 A. D. Its occasion (1 Cor. 1. 11, 12). Its purpose, to
set forth a true church-life.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>2.) <i>Second Corinthians</i> (57 A. D.), probably written from
Macedonia. (2 Cor. 7. 5; 8. 1); its purpose, mainly a defense
of Paul's apostolic authority.</p>

<p>3.) <i>Galatians</i>, also probably from Macedonia (57 A. D). Its
occasion, the influence of Judaizing teachers on Paul's
churches in Galatia (Gal. 1. 6, 7). "Galatia" may refer to the
regions in Lycaonia and Pisidia (according to Ramsay); but
most expositors refer it to Galatia Proper, north of those
provinces. The theme of this book is "Salvation by faith
<i>only</i>."</p>

<p>4.) <i>Romans</i> was written from Corinth perhaps in 58 A. D.
See Rom. 16. 1, a reference to the seaport of Corinth. Its
subject is "Justification by Faith." Notice how important
were the writings of this period.</p></div>

<p>5. <i>The return journey</i> (Acts 20. 6-21, 17). Note the route and
places, which should be traced on the map. 1.) Philippi (Acts 20.
6). 2.) Troas (Acts 20. 6-13). What took place at Troas? 3.)
Voyage to Miletus (Acts 20. 14, 15). 4.) At Miletus, a touching
address (Acts 20. 17-38). 5.) Voyage to Tyre (Acts 21. 1-6). 6.)
Ptolemais (Acts 21. 7). 7.) Cæsarea (Acts 21. 8-15.) A remarkable
meeting. 8.) Jerusalem (Acts 21. 17). Paul's errand to
Jerusalem was to present the contribution of the Gentile churches;
seeking to reconcile them with the mother church in Jerusalem,
which was exceedingly bigoted in its zeal for the law (Acts 21. 20,
21).</p>

<p>6. <b>Paul's arrest and imprisonment</b> (Acts 21. 27-34). Our purpose
is not to narrate the personal life of St. Paul but to show the
development of the Christian church, therefore we do not enter
into the details of his experience. He was arrested in Jerusalem, and
placed in the castle of Antonia for his protection (Acts 21. 24);
subsequently taken to Cæsarea (Acts 23. 25-35). Here he
remained in prison two years (Acts 24. 27). During this time Paul
was placed on trial at least four times: 1.) Before the Jewish
council of the Sanhedrim. (Acts 23. 1-10.) 2.) Before the Roman
governor or procurator Felix. (Acts 24:. 1-22.) 3.) Before Festus,
the successor of Felix. (Acts 25. 1-12.) 4.) Before Agrippa, the
ethnarch of the Bashan district, called by courtesy "King Agrippa."

<p>IV. <b>Paul's Fourth Journey</b> (Acts 27 and 28). Although made
by a prisoner, some of the time wearing a chain (Acts 26. 29; 28. 20),
the journey to Rome was a missionary journey, in many respects
like Paul's other journeys. To visit Rome had long been his
desire and expectation (Acts 19. 21. Rom. 1. 15. Rom. 15. 23, 24).
His companions on the journey, Luke, Aristarchus (Acts 27. 1, 2),
and probably Timothy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>1. On the voyage he was able to bring the <i>gospel to the island
of Malta</i> (Acts 28. 7-10).</p>

<p>2. Arriving at <i>Rome</i> (Acts 28. 16) he took up his work as nearly
as possible according to his <i>regular method</i>. 1.) He found a <i>home</i>
and <i>employment</i> (Acts 28. 16). 2.) As he could not go to the synagogue
he <i>sent for the chief Jews</i> and preached the gospel to them
(Acts 28. 17-24). 3.) He then turned to the Gentiles (Acts 28.
28-31). 4.) Some <i>results</i> of his ministry in Rome (Phil 1. 12-18).</p>

<p>3. <i>The Epistles of Paul's Imprisonment at Rome.</i> The order of
these is uncertain, but they belong rather to the close of the period
than to its opening.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) <i>Ephesians</i>; called by S. T. Coleridge "the divinest composition
of man;" written A. D. 62; its subject, "The mystical
union of Christ and his church."</p>

<p>2.) <i>Philippians</i>; the most affectionate of all Paul's letters;
written A. D. 62; its subject "The character of Christ's followers."</p>

<p>3.) <i>Colossians</i>; written to a church that Paul had never seen;
about A. D. 62; subject, "Christ the Head of the Church."</p>

<p>4.) <i>Philemon</i>: a personal letter to a friend at Colossæ concerning
a <i>runaway slave</i> Onesimus, whom Paul sent back, "no
longer a slave, but a brother beloved."</p></div>

<p>V. <b>Paul's Later Years.</b> The record is uncertain, and almost
unknown. It is probable, though not certain, that Paul was set
free about 63 A. D.</p>

<p>1. <i>His years of liberty.</i> 63 to 67 A. D. Shall we speak of a
<i>fifth journey</i>? We find hints or expectations of his being at Colossæ
(Philem. 22); Miletus (2 Tim. 4. 13); Nicopolis, north of Greece, on
the Adriatic Sea (Titus 3. 12). Tradition states that at this place
he was arrested, and sent from it a second time to Rome.</p>

<p>2. <i>His last epistles.</i> It is not certain that all the "pastoral
epistles" were written by Paul. 1.) They are unlike his other writings
in their style. 2.) His doctrinal views are not prominent in
them. Yet on the whole, they show a reasonable probability of
Paul's authorship.</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>1.) <i>First Timothy</i> was written during the period of liberty,
between 63 and 66 A. D., as a book of <i>counsels to a minister</i>,
Timothy, in charge of the church at Ephesus.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>2.) <i>Titus</i>, about the same time and for the same purpose; to
Titus, in charge of churches on the island of Crete.</p>

<p>3.) <i>Second Timothy</i>, from Rome, during Paul's second and
last imprisonment; a letter of farewell counsels to his "son
Timothy." Strictly speaking this book should be named
under the next subject.</p></div>

<p>VI. <b>The First Imperial Persecution.</b> The Christians were
becoming numerous in Rome, as well as throughout the empire;
and a conflict was sure to arise with the Roman government. The
first persecution came soon after the burning of Rome, A. D. 64,
which Nero charged falsely upon the Christians. Thousands were
put to death, although the persecution was mainly limited to the
capital. The <i>martyrdom of St. Paul</i>, probably of St. Peter also,
took place about 68 A. D. at Rome.</p>

<h2>EIGHTEENTH STUDY</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The End of the Age</div>

<h3>From the Death of St. Paul, A. D. 68, to the Death of St. John,
100 A. D.</h3>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Part One</span></div>

<p>We come now to our last period, an <i>age of shadows</i>, of which we
know very little, and wish that we knew more. The curtain of New
Testament history falls while St. Paul is still a prisoner at Rome,
five years before the supposed date of his death. From that time,
A. D. 63, to about A. D. 125 there is very little history, and none in
the New Testament; we are left to hints, traditions, and conjectures.</p>

<p>A question which we would like to answer is, What became of
the <i>companions</i> of St. Paul: such men as Timothy (Heb. 13. 23),
Titus (2 Tim. 4. 10), Apollos (Titus 3. 13), Luke (2 Tim. 4. 11)?
All of these were living and working at the close of Paul's life; but
there is no report of their life and labors after that event.</p>

<p>Another perplexing fact is that when the curtain rises at about 125
A. D. it shows us a very <i>different church</i> from that of St. Paul's day:
a church completely organized, with bishops in almost absolute
control; and sects quarreling over controversies apparently
unknown when St. Paul wrote his letters.</p>

<p>While Peter and Paul were living the church had wise and statesmanlike
leaders, who directed its energies. But when these great
men died "second-rate men" were left in control and they were not
equal to the demand of the new time; and the church drifted into
disputes, which grew into divisions. Let us notice the few known
<b>Events of this Period</b>.</p>

<p>I. <b>The Fall of Jerusalem</b>: epoch-making, not only to Jewish but
also to Christian history.</p>

<p>1. The <i>rebellion of the Jews</i> against the Roman power began in
68 A. D.; hopeless from the beginning&mdash;for how could one small state
measure swords with the empire of the civilized world? The city
of Jerusalem was taken and destroyed 70 A. D., and with it fell forever
the Jewish state.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The <i>siege had been predicted</i> in the gospels (Matt. 24. 15-18;
Mark 13. 14), and was expected by the disciples of Christ. The
<i>Christians</i> in Jerusalem and Judea <i>withdrew</i> to <i>Pella</i> in the Jordan
valley; but their numbers were not large, showing that Jewish Christianity
must have declined since A. D. 58 (see Acts 21. 20), while
Gentile Christianity had increased. After the destruction of Jerusalem
Jewish Christianity remained for 200 years a feeble and
declining sect, hated by their own people as traitors, and despised
by Gentile Christians because they still observed the Jewish law.</p>

<p>3. The effect of the fall of Jerusalem was to draw a sharp line of
<i>division between Jews and Christians</i>. Before, the two classes had
been closely related, and confused in the popular mind. Thenceforth
the two streams ran further and further apart, and have continued
apart even to our own time. All Jewish rites ceased in the
church, Christians could no longer be Jews; and after 125 A. D.
Jews could no longer be Christians without renouncing Judaism.
The church was now thoroughly a Gentile, non-Jewish church.
Note in the gospel of John how "the Jews" are everywhere named
as enemies of Christ (John 5. 16; 7. 1; 11. 8; 18. 36); and yet the
author of this book was himself a Jew by birth and training; but
at the time of writing he had ceased to be a Jew.</p>

<p>II. <b>St. John at Ephesus.</b> Ephesus, at the western end of Asia
Minor, was now the leading city of Christianity. It is probable that
the apostle John passed the last thirty years of his life in that city.
He was revered as the <i>last of the apostles</i>; but he was not a statesman
or man of affairs; rather a mystic and man of meditation. It
is supposed that he died about 100 A. D. but the date is not certain.</p>

<p>III. <b>The Rise of the Heresies.</b> 1. This was the inevitable
<i>result of the Greek mind</i> working on the simple doctrines of the gospel.
The Christian doctrine was Jewish; and the Jewish mind was not
given to subtle intellectual questions. But when Christianity ceased
to be Jewish and began to Gentile it was dominated by the Greek
spirit of restless inquiry. Asia Minor was the home of wild, uncontrolled
thinking. Sects almost without number appeared, wrangled,
and divided over every article of the creed. The more mysterious
the question, the more apart from practical life and from human
interest, the more fascinating became the study.</p>

<p>2. Two great classes of sects embraced many minor groups.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>1.) <i>The Ebionites.</i> Strict Jews, who sought to make Christianity a
branch of Pharisaism, keeping the Jewish law. 2.) <i>The Gnostics.</i>
People with peculiar views concerning the nature of God, heavenly
beings, the nature of Christ.</p>

<p>3. The <i>results</i> of these controversies were both good and evil. 1.)
<i>Good</i> in that the clashing of ideas aided in <i>fixing</i> in permanent form
the true <i>doctrines</i> of the church. 2.) But far more <i>evil</i>; for the energies
of the members were absorbed in debate and controversy;
the spiritual life of the church greatly declined; the aim ceased to
be devotion to Christ, but was now orthodoxy in belief. Christianity
became a creed, instead of an inner spiritual life.</p>

<p>IV. <b>The Second Imperial Persecution</b>; under the emperor Domitian,
son of Titus, about A. D. 95. This was far more widely
extended than the former persecution under Nero; and it was
followed by a long series of persecutions, wherein untold thousands
of Christians were put to death. The inevitable conflict had come
between Christianity and the Roman empire, and it lasted two hundred
years; but at its close the cross was triumphant over the
Roman eagles. It is not difficult to see the <i>causes</i> of this <i>struggle</i>:</p>

<p>1. <i>Heathenism was hospitable</i>, welcoming new gods and goddesses,
while <i>Christianity was exclusive</i>, opposing with all its might every
other form of worship.</p>

<p>2. <i>Idol-worship</i> and its services were <i>interwoven</i> with all the <i>life of
the people</i>; personal, family, social, political. Temples, statues,
festivals were constantly in evidence; on all occasions there were
rites of worship. But here was a growing multitude of people
who stood aloof from these exercises. It was not strange that
these people were regarded as enemies of society and of the state.</p>

<p>3. Certain forms of religion were allowed in the Roman empire,
but all new forms were forbidden. <i>Judaism was a permitted</i> religion.
As long as Christianity was looked upon as a branch of Judaism,
it was allowed. But after the fall of Jerusalem it stood alone,
an unlicensed form of worship, hence under suspicion; suspicion
readily becoming enmity.</p>

<p>4. <i>The worship of the emperor</i> was the one most prevalent
throughout the empire. A statue of the reigning emperor stood in
every city, and it was a test of loyalty to offer libations of incense
before it. This worship is doubtless referred to in an enigmatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
manner in such passages as 2 Thess. 2. 3, 4. Rev. 13. 1, 4, 8, 18.
This worship was refused by the Christians, who were for that reason
regarded as disloyal.</p>

<p>From these causes persecution after persecution arose; hundreds
of thousands perished; yet in spite of the persecution, the church
grew rapidly.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Part Two</span></div>

<p>Let us consider the <b>condition of the church</b> at the end of the first
century, seventy years after the Ascension of our Lord.</p>

<p>I. <b>Its Numbers</b> cannot be definitely stated; but the church was
very large, and growing with marvelous rapidity. Sources of
information: 1.) <i>The catacombs</i>; cemeteries under and around Rome
where Christians only were buried, and wherein they met in times
of persecution; occupied between 100 and 400 A. D.; containing in
three centuries two million graves of Christians. 2.) A letter of
Pliny, Roman governor of Bithynia-Pontus in Asia Minor, 112
A. D., stating that "the temples were almost deserted," "an
incredible number of professors." Evidences point to the church,
A. D. 100, having already a large proportion of the population of
the Roman empire.</p>

<p>II. <b>Its Membership.</b> 1. Once the church had been entirely
Jewish; then it became Jewish and Gentile; now it was almost
everywhere a Gentile church, with a few Jewish members, most of
whom had abandoned Jewish rites and rules and were regarded
by the Jews as "apostates."</p>

<p>2. <i>Its social condition</i> was varied. It is a mistake to suppose that
at any time the early church was composed mainly of slaves and
the poorest classes. Such there were; but there were also men of
wealth, of high rank, and of great influence. There is reason to
believe that some relatives of the emperor, previous to 100 A. D.
were banished on account of their Christian profession. The gospel
had by this time permeated all classes.</p>

<p>III. <b>Its Organization.</b> We observe in this respect a remarkable
change since the period of St. Paul's ministry. Everywhere the
church was hardening into an <i>ecclesiastical system ruled by bishops</i>.
Bishops are first mentioned late in St. Paul's ministry (Acts 20. 28;
Rev. Ver. Phil. 1. 1; 1 Tim. 3. 1-7); but it is evident that the
word at that time meant no more than "elder;" otherwise the elders
of Ephesus would not have been called "bishops" in Acts 20.28. But
in an autocratic state the church would naturally become autocratic
in its arrangement, ruled from above rather than from below.
By 125 A. D. bishops were in control everywhere.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. <b>Its Institutions.</b> Two of these require notice. 1. <i>The
Lord's Supper.</i> We have seen how this began as a service in the
home, like the Jewish Passover, out of which it grew (Acts 2. 46).
But among Gentile churches the custom arose of celebrating it at
a public meeting, as a supper to which each member brought some
share of provision. See 1 Cor. 11. 20-30, an account of abuses
that had arisen. By the end of the first century the supper had
become a service held at the meeting place of the Christians, but not
in public. All except members of the church were excluded from
this service, which was held as a "mystery."</p>

<p>2. <i>The Lord's Day.</i> The observance of the first day of the week
grew gradually, and with its growth the recognition of the Jewish
sabbath declined. Note the development indicated in 1 Cor. 16. 2;
Acts 20. 7; Rev. 1. 10. As the church became entirely a Gentile
institution "the Lord's day" took the place of the Jewish sabbath.</p>

<p>V. <b>Its Doctrinal System.</b> The <i>theology of St. Paul</i>, as set forth
in Romans and Ephesians, was now accepted as the doctrine of the
church. Notice that St. Peter (1 Pet. 1. 18-21) states the great
Pauline principle of justification by faith through the blood of
Christ.</p>

<p>VI. <b>Its Literature.</b> By 100 A. D. all the books of the New Testament
were written, though not all of them were everywhere
accepted as authoritative. In some places there were questions
about Hebrews, 2 Peter and Revelation; the latter because local
in its address, and so recent in origin as not to be known everywhere.
But the gospels (except John, which was about 95 A. D. in
its date), the Acts and nearly all the epistles were read in all the
churches as possessing an inspired authority. Note that, in 2
Peter, Paul's writings are placed on a par with "the other Scriptures,"
which must refer to the Old Testament.</p>

<p>VII. <b>Its Spiritual Life.</b> It must be admitted that there had
been a decline in the fervency of the Christian life in the church.
Its moral standards were still high; but spiritual gifts had become less
noticeable; the rule of bishops and councils and the controversies
over doctrines were weakening the fervor of spirituality. Note
the difference in spirit and tone between the writings of the New
Testament and those of the early church-fathers in the second
century.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class='cap'>THE necessity of some instruction in the Bible in order to supply the
deficiencies which are unavoidable to any system of uniform lessons,
is realized in every Sunday school. The International Lessons can
only give detached portions of Scripture, and a supplemental lesson must
be added to impart a general knowledge of the book as a whole.</div>

<p>The full course of study includes five series of lessons, adapted to be
used in any denomination.</p>
